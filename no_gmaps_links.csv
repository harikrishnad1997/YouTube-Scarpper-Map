A few weeks ago, I was invited to witness culinary history in Chennai. A single dining table, 156 feet long, would play host to 106 guests who would be dining on 10 courses representing 10 regional Indian cuisines presented by the top 10 chefs of the country. Curated by Chef Regi Mathew who found an equally passionate partner in 'India champion', connoisseur and entrepreneur, Mr. Hanu Reddy to support this initiative, this evening at Hanu Reddy Farms, 40 kilometres outside Chennai was nothing short of magical! This was truly a dining experience unlike any other.

I hope you enjoy my video account of this evening. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

You know I love my dosae - watching it being made, learning what makes each version special, and savouring it with joy. Imagine my excitement then to learn of dosae history being made, right here in Namma Bengaluru. Well, that‚Äôs exactly what MTR Foods chose to do to celebrate 100 years of MTR‚Äôs iconic culinary legacy. In a move truly befitting of the time, the chefs at this food brand chose to shatter the previous Guinness record for the world‚Äôs longest dosa. And they did so convincingly, by going more than twice the distance!

The dosae is iconic and fabled here in Bengaluru, and now it stands tall, or should I say long :-), with this Guinness record - the world‚Äôs longest dosae. I was privileged to be invited to the MTR Foods factory on this momentous occasion, and in this special Gourmet On The Road episode, we bring you the excitement from the day when dosae history was made!

Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Mrs. Geetha Shivkumar saw farmers unable to sell their stock of avarebele (hyacinth beans) 25 years ago, she co-opted them into an initiative that would make use of this delicately flavoured ingredient in a myriad of savouries, sweets and snacks. What began as a humble initiative out of her home then has today bloomed into an inspiring ‚Äòfarm to table‚Äô movement, the Shree Vasavi Condiments Avarebele Mela that has spread awareness on this humble bean and also provided much needed livelihood to many farmers in Karnataka. 

Now in its 24th year, this festival is being staged in a large venue at the National College grounds, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru from 5th to 9th January. Hope this episode inspires you to visit this one-of-a-kind culinary festival and savour the avarebele in a variety of tasty forms. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Having tasted their unbelievably tasty read to eat products, I wrangled for myself an invitation to visit the Tasty Nibbles food factory. And was amazed at their fastidious approach to hygiene that goes into the making of each of their delicious preparations. I also got a peek into the Retort technology that makes it possible for them to pack for shelf storage at room temperature without any added preservatives. Before I left the factory, I also partook of some more of their specialties, including a first tasting of their to be launched Duck Mapapas and Kuttanadan curry. If you‚Äôre looking to taste authentic flavours of Kerala, in a jiffy, anywhere in the country, do check out the Tasty Nibbles website (details below).

I hope you enjoy this factory tour and tasting episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

I recently heard of a gentleman in Kochi who is on a mission to make Kerala food available to diners not just in Kerala but across the country and the globe. Intrigued, I accepted Mr Cherian Kurian‚Äôs invitation to a traditional, Kerala lunch, where I was impressed not just with the food but the science that goes into its creation. I hope you enjoy this delicious, indulgent repast of traditional delicacies. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It had been a while since I savoured the street food delicacies of Mosque Road, Frazer Town, Bengaluru, especially the sort that are showcased around Ramzan. And so with my friend, Chef Fasiulla to guide me, we set about tasting the fare on offer this year. A combination of classics from age old eateries, and some surprising new twists with influences that draw from beyond Bengaluru. Whilst the street food vibe with the stalls and the buzz of food lovers during Ramzan is quite unique, what‚Äôs heartening is that many of the must-try dishes are now offered through the year.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

The pandemic was tough on the hospitality industry and the people who worked in it, many who found themselves out of employment. My good friend, Chef Amit Wadhawan however saw in this adversity an opportunity to convert an interest, that of bottling traditional and modern expressions of flavours in a hand crafted range of jams, chutneys, pickles and preserves, into a small business. Sold under the name, Supernatural Society, these delicious offerings are cooked by him personally in small batches sans any preservative, low sugar and with perhaps the highest concentration of fruits and other natural ingredients. I caught up with Amit in Delhi over a delightful tasting of some of his jars.

Hope you enjoy this watch. Please do your best to support small businesses like this. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

In the second part of my Mavalli Tiffin Rooms morning with the inimitable Rocky Singh, we touch upon some important aspects of food that we take for granted especially at legacy eateries. We speak of the change in culinary ingredients, the fact that food preparations too have their own unique personalities, the effort it takes to preserve traditions and also discuss Rocky‚Äôs love for the dosae and bisi bele bath amongst other interesting things. 

Hope you also caught the first part of this tiffin talk at https://youtu.be/iMyRs_tSU_Q

I recently met Rocky SIngh of the Rocky & Mayur duo, one of the country‚Äôs earliest and perhaps most recognised food and travel personalities. Invited to his hit show,  #RoadTrippinWithRocky where we enjoyed a delicious Bengaluru breakfast at Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, I seized the opportunity to chat much about food, food reviews, culinary legacies, and also the one question that many of their followers have been asking of him: Where Is Mayur? 

Hope you enjoy this fun tiffin talk, stay tuned for the second part of this conversation. Happy eating!

Zain‚Äôs Hotel Kozhikode stands testament to Mrs Zainabi Noor‚Äôs firm resolve to showcase the Mappila cuisine of her family. Kozhikode‚Äôs first lady restaurateur, she began her culinary enterprise 32 years ago as a small tea stall dispensing evening snacks. Spurred by the love she received from her customers, Zain‚Äôs today stands tall in Calicut as the address for homestyle Malabar cuisine.

In this throwback episode, I visit  this cosy restaurant set in a home and meets the mother-daughter duo of Zainabi Noor and Shireen Mustafa who oversee every detail of the operation. And also look at the making of their popular chicken biryani, ghee rice and chicken masala in their kitchen ‚Äòmanned‚Äô only by lady cooks, before sitting down to a generous lunch.

In the second part of my Adyar Ananda Bhavan Chennai factory tour, I caught up with 2nd generation brothers, K. T. Venkatesan and Srinivasa Raja, who attribute in a large part their inspirational success to the lessons learned from their parents. I also catch the making of some more sweets and the spectacular automated manufacturing lines of A2B snacks that churn out a range of popular traditional savouries.

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating and stay inspired!

I recently received an invitation that compelled me to drive 350 kilometres to visit the Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets & Snacks Factory in Ambattur, Chennai. A2B, as the group is popularly known, is now perhaps South India‚Äôs most recognised restaurant, sweets and snacks brand, with over 150 outlets across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and overseas, however its origins are rather humble and trace an agricultural family‚Äôs inspiring 60-year journey through Rajapalyam, Bengaluru, Chennai and beyond. As I learnt from the second and third generation of the Adyar Ananda Bhavan family when I visited their facility that can produce over 40,000 kilos of savouries and 10,000 kilos of sweets evry single day! 

What is heartening though is the family‚Äôs commitment to sourcing quality ingredients, even making their own ghee to ensure 100% purity, and fostering an environment where the skill and craft involved in making artisanal handmade sweets is also encouraged alongside automated production lines to meet the burgeoning demand for their sweets and savouries. I hope you enjoy the first part of this very special episode this Deepavali weekend.

Happy Diwali! Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

We stumbled into this tiny home eatery in Mudigere run by a young couple, Ravi and Vidya Pujari who began this to supplement their marginal coffee growing income. The food is Mangalorean, revolving around seafood that is procured fresh. We landed on the second Saturday of a month, a day when they supposedly don‚Äôt have too many customers and therefore do not procure a large variety of seafood. But what we tasted was the sort that was satisfying enough. The fries may have been slightly overdone, but was tasty nonetheless and the curries the sort that hit the spot along with a pleasing crab ghee roast. What‚Äôs nice overall is the warming hospitality with which the couple serve you in their modest eatery. Definitely a lunch spot to try should you be in and around Mudigere in Karnataka. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A visit to Goa is always memorable.

We stayed a week in Goa exploring its culinary fare, from meals in fabled, century-old institutions, to establishments that serve up a delightful showcase of community cuisine, Saraswat and Catholic, to uncovering some tiny unsung hole-in-the-wall joints, savoring street food and more. Stay tuned to Food Lovers TV over the next few weeks as we roll out these Goa episodes; each eatery featured a must-add to your next Goa visit. For now, here‚Äôs a preview of what‚Äôs in store.

Hi food lovers tv family, hope you are doing well. In this q&a, I delve into the many questions you have on our restaurant selection process, how we go about our shoots, my inspirations, how do i manage to keep some semblance of fitness despite all that I eat, our earnings, and why do i always wear a hat? And lots more.

Hi folks, I hope you are doing well. This is a video that I have put together based on requests I have received from many of our viewers to illustrate do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts when ordering takeaway food.

I want to share with you measures that I take when I am ordering food, from a taste, safety, and peace of mind perspective. Hope you find this useful, I have also placed some of my research reference links below. Stay safe and happy eating!

Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support the eatery and others like this establishment that need help in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.

Links to references I have looked up to determine if eating outside food is safe:

Specifically, coronaviruses are thermolabile, which means that they are susceptible to normal cooking temperatures (70¬∞C). Therefore, as a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.
Source: WHO https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200221-sitrep-32-covid-19.pdf

Food containers and packaging. There's no evidence of anyone contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 after touching food containers and food packaging. Many restaurants are now offering no-contact takeout and delivery to lessen the risk of transmission.

Still, if you're concerned, it's reasonable to follow general food safety guidelines. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water after handling takeout containers, and then transfer food to a clean dish using clean utensils. Wash your hands again before eating. After disposing of containers, clean and disinfect any surfaces that had takeout containers on them.

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease spreading from person to person. It‚Äôs not a foodborne disease. There‚Äôs no evidence to suggest people will get infected by swallowing the virus in, or on, food or drink.

Great food should be physically accessible to all food lovers, shouldn‚Äôt it? But the sad truth is, it isn‚Äôt! I recently received a message from one of our viewers speaking from experience of the challenges that those in wheelchairs face, trying to manoeuvre from their vehicle on the street onto the sidewalk, the premises, and then to the eatery. To help the community of wheelchair users, can you try and do one simple thing. 

When you put up a restaurant post on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or any other social media, include the hashtag #wheelchairaccessible in your post in case the restaurant is.

Let‚Äôs try and help build a resource of #wheelchairaccessible eateries for those who rely on wheelchairs for mobility. Do share, repost and help spread the word. üôèüôè

When it comes to food personalities in Karnataka, Sihi Kahi Chandru is perhaps one name that everyone knows. An acclaimed actor, director and producer, he has endeared himself in the hearts of every Kannadiga for his prolific food shows on television. Over the last couple of years that I have been producing Gourmet On The Road, I have received numerous comments requesting for a collab with him, so it was a pleasant surprise and an honour to receive a call from him inviting me as a guest to Bombat Bhojana, his show on Star Suvarna. In this vlog, I share a behind the scenes peek on my participation in the show and a quick conversation with the legend himself.

Hope you enjoy the vlog, and do tune in to the episode of Bombat Bhojana on Star Suvarna on 30th January at 12pm IST.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our subscribers for making this happen, When we began this journey 20 months ago with barely a few thousand subscribers, we had no idea where it would take us. But, here we are thanks entirely to the support of each one of our subscribers and everyone at Food Lovers TV who has been a part of this adventure.

Over the last few months, we have had the opportunity to shine the light on many culinary enterprises adversely affected by the current situation, and help them get back on their feet. Even as we cross the 500,000 subscriber mark and head to a million over the next few months, we would like to continue supporting deserving eateries that have an interesting story to be told.

Watch this short video to know more.

Thank you.

In this throwback video, I share with you a meal that I savoured in the home of Mrs Jayanti in the tiny fishing hamlet of Kovalam, Tamil Nadu. I tasted a Prawns Thokku, Para Kozhambu, and even a dried fish, Karuvadu, that tides the community through times when fish is not easily available. Hope you enjoy this short and sweet episode.

"#Mangalorean #FishCurry #Recipe

Easy Fish Curry, Mangalorean Fish Curry, Fish Curry Rice, Indian Fish Curry, Seer Fish Curry, Pomfret Curry, Prawn Curry, Mangalore, Seafood, Kudla, Easy Recipe

The Mangalorean fish curry is the perfect balance of spice, heat and sour. In this recipe episode, we cook up a seer fish curry from scratch, including a vivacious masala that lends itself well to any mild-flavoured fish like pomfret, kingfish, ladyfish, or even prawns. Its beautiful bright reddish-orange hue comes from the combination of Kashmiri & Guntur chillies I prefer to use in this traditional preparation from namma Kudla. Traditionally, the curry is prepared atleast a couple of hours ahead of meal time, thereby allowing the fish to soak up the flavoursome masala. Served with steaming hot rice, this is a curry that pleases the soul! Enjoy!

Hope you enjoy my recipe adaptation of the Udupi Hayagreeva; I find in this a divinely delicious, nutritious and guilt-free fix to a sudden dessert craving, given that it can be whipped up quite easily at very short notice. Enjoy!

Prawn Pulao, Prawn Pulav, Prawn Biryani, Mangalorean Prawn Pulao, Coriander & Mint Masala, Mangalore, Prawn Pulao Recipe, Recipe, Seafood, Prawn Recipe, One Dish Meal, Spicy Prawn Pulao, Prawn Pulav

The Mangalorean Prawn Pulao is unlike any seafood pulao. At its heart is an aromatic coriander-mint masala that complements the sweetness of fresh shrimps, and lends this rice dish an appealing greenish hue and a unique fulsome flavour. One of my favourite food memories growing up, this was a pulao cooked by my Mom on special occasions like birthdays,  with plenty of medium-sized prawns, thereby ensuring a taste of the crustacean in every mouthful. And she would also find in this pulao the perfect medium to include finely chopped carrots and beans to feed veggies to her fussy kids. ;-) This pulao recipe is truly special to me, I hope you find it special enough to cook too. Take care and stay safe. Enjoy! 

Mangalorean Prawn Pulao
Serves 4

Ingredients:

500 gm medium-sized prawns (roughly around 40 to 50 prawns) 
2 large onions, finely chopped
2 carrots, finely chopped
10 beans, finely chopped
1 cup peas
8 cloves
5 to 6 green cardamoms
1 inch cinnamon
Oil/ ghee to cook
Salt to taste

For the masala
1 big bunch of coriander and stalk,
1 cup of mint leaves 
Ensure coriander and mint are in a 60:40 ratio.
8 to 9 green chillies
1 inch of ginger, peeled and sliced
10 to 12 pods of garlic
1 tsp of turmeric powder
1 tsp salt

"#gourmetontheroad #fishing #tamilnadu

#fisherman #fishing #lifeofafisherman #kovalam #tamilnadu #chennai #fishfry #seafood #seafoodfry #gourmetbiker 

There is much hardship and uncertainty a fisherman endures each day to bring us our favourite harvest of the sea. In this video from our earliest culinary explorations, we travelled to the tiny fishing village of Kovalam in Tamil Nadu to spend a day with Selvam. We took a boat ride into the ocean where this sunburnt fisherman shared with us a moving account of what it takes to carry on with the traditions of his community. On our return, we stopped at his favourite stall to taste some seafood fries. Hope you find this episode an interesting watch, and take a moment to remember not just the fishing community but the many growers and producers who must face enormous difficulties to bring to us the food that nourishes and sustains us, especially in these unforeseen times. Stay safe.

Akuri, Parsi Scrambled Eggs, Spicy Scrambled Eggs, Desi Eggs, Parsi Dish, Parsi Cuisine, Irani Restaurant Breakfast, Breakfast. Eggs, Eggs Recipe, Easy Recipe, Parsi Sambar Masala, Authentic Recipe, Mumbai, Parsi Dish, Bombay

In this lockdown recipe episode, we celebrate the humble ‚Äòanda‚Äô in the making of an Akuri, the spicy Parsi version of scrambled eggs. Some confuse this dish with the Mumbai street food staple, ‚Äòanda bhurji‚Äô, but the Parsi Akuri is a different dish altogether, from its nuanced spice notes, its depth of flavour, and its texture, comparable to a savoury custard. Growing up in Mumbai, this was a dish I would savour in Irani restaurants with some kadak brun pav, or in Parsi homes. I dig deep into my food memories to cook this comforting ‚Äòeggy‚Äô dish, perfect for breakfast or a lazy lunch. Enjoy, stay safe and happy cooking.

Ingredients

Serves 2

3 eggs
1 tbsp ghee, you could use refined oil as well.
Knob of cold butter butter for finishing
2 medium sized onions, chopped finely (roughly ¬Ω onion per egg) 
2 medium sized tomatoes, chopped finely (roughly ¬Ω tomato per egg)
4 to 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 to 3 green chillies, finely chopped
¬æ 1 tsp red chilli powder
¬Ω tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp Parsi sambar masala (optional) The Parsi sambar masala is that special touch that adds depth of flavour to the dish. It is a concoction of chilli powder, turmeric, asafoetida, fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, peppercorn, star anise, cloves and cinnamon, ground together, and then combined with heated sesame oil). If you don‚Äôt have this, you can use any garam masala to add flavour depth.
2 to 3 tbsp coriander, chopped
Salt to taste

"#Kundapur #Chicken #GheeRoast  

Ghee Roast, Chicken Ghee Roast, Prawn Ghee Roast, Veg Ghee Roast, Recipe, Shetty Lunch Home, Mangalore, Kundapur, Authentic Recipe, Karnataka, Ghee, Chilli, Chicken, Kundapur Masala, Kundapur Ghee Roast, Kundapur Chicken Ghee Roast, Ghee Roast Mangalorean Style, Ghee Roast Kundapur Style

One of my all-time favourite comfort foods is the Kundapur Ghee Roast. A dish born decades ago in a tiny eatery called Shetty Lunch Home in the then sleepy hamlet of Kundapur along the South Canara coastline. Over the years, this spicy preparation has conquered palates across the country and beyond. What gives this dish its soul is the roasted Kundapur Masala, that manifests itself in the spicy, tangy, robust flavours of this preparation. Over the years, I have tasted many ghee roasts and watched its making in illustrious kitchens, including Shetty Lunch Home. This recipe, my ode to the dish and its creators, is versatile enough to be made not only with chicken, the original chicken ghee roast, but also with prawns, paneer or any veggie of your choice. Enjoy, stay safe and happy cooking.

1 kg chicken or prawn or vegetable of your choice

For the marinade:
4 to 5 tbsp yoghurt
1 to 1 ¬Ω tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp chilli powder
1 to 2 tsp salt (to taste)
1 tsp lemon juice/ vinegar

For the Kundapur Masala
8 dried Guntur chillies
10 dried Byadgi chillies
2 Tsp peppercorns
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
2 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tbsp thick tamarind pulp 
16 - 20 garlic cloves
Water as required

To cook:
6 to 8 tbsp ghee 
20-30 nos curry leaves
Salt as required
1 tsp jaggery
1 tsp vinegar
A pinch of coriander powder

"#Biryani #StayHome #Bangalore 

Biryani Delivered Home, Lockdown Biryani, Stay Home Biryani, Behrouz Biryani, Vegetable Biryani, Subz-E-Biryani, Dum Gosht Biryani, Bhuna Chicken Biryani, Bangalore

I had heard much of Behrouz Biryani, or rather had consumed many of its slick ads touting a mythical kingdom and the story of a 2000-year-old recipe! So when the craving to indulge in some biryani in this lockdown hit me real hard, I decided to order in and put this ‚Äòstoried‚Äô biryani to the test. Did the biryani live up to the tale, or was its advertised appeal as mythical as its story? Well, you will have to watch the video to find out. Enjoy and stay safe, folks!

#gourmetontheroad #gotrraw #athome #foodloverstv 

Subz-e-Biryani
The vegetables consisted of peas, carrots, potatoes and cauliflowers, mushy for the most part, and slathered in a rich masala. The rice though was cooked perfectly, each grain blossomed to its fullest. Rs. 286 (usd 3.7) 
6/10

Lazeez Bhuna Murg Biryani
With tonnes of masala, this isn't a biryani that will endear itself if you‚Äôre looking for something delicate. The rice is cooked well, garnished with slivers of almonds, but suspiciously tastes just like the rice in the vegetable biryani. The chicken is firm, not juicy and succulent.
Rs. 314 (usd 4.1)
5/10

Dum Gosht Biryani
With three or five juicy pieces of meat slathered in masala, this is a biryani that could feed two. The meat is soft and moist, cooked perfectly. Taste with plenty of mint raita to wash down the warmth of the spices in the masala. 
Rs. 448 (usd 5.9)
7/10


We ordered for these biryanis on a delivery app. Our total bill came up to Rs. 1098 including taxes.

"#Kerala #PackedLunch #Lunch  

Pothichoru, Pothi Choru, Kerala‚Äôs Most Popular Packed Lunch, Kerala Lunch, Malayali Lunch, Lunch On The Go, Banana Leaf Lunch, Vegetarian Pothichoru, Rice, Sambar, Aviyal, Fish Fry, Chicken Roast

Hi folks, a few days ago, I ordered a Pothichoru, a Kerala packed lunch, for those not in the know, Pothi = Bundle and Choru = Rice. This rice bundle  tradition, I am told, is the lunch lifeline in Kerala, where every morning the ladies of the house pack rice with the day‚Äôs curries, vegetables, fries, sides and pickles into warmed banana leaf parcels for family members to carry to homes, schools and offices. Here‚Äôs my experience of tasting a Pothichoru in Bengaluru. 
Enjoy!

"#MappilaCuisine #Kozhikode #GourmetOnTheRoad

Authentic Moplah Cuisine in Kozhikode at Zain‚Äôs Hotel, Calicut, Mappila Cuisine, Chatti Pathiri, Kallumakaya, Mutton Stew, Chicken Biryani, Ghee Rice, Chicken Masala

Zain‚Äôs Hotel Kozhikode stands testament to Mrs Zainabi Noor‚Äôs firm resolve to showcase the Mappila cuisine of her family. Kozhikode‚Äôs first lady restaurateur, she began her culinary enterprise 29 years ago as a small tea stall dispensing evening snacks. Spurred by the love she received from her customers, Zain‚Äôs today stands tall in Calicut as the address for homestyle Malabar cuisine.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits this cosy restaurant set in a home and meets the mother-daughter duo of Zainabi Noor and Shireen Mustafa who oversee every detail of the operation. He also looks at the making of their popular chicken biryani, ghee rice and chicken masala in their kitchen ‚Äòmanned‚Äô only by lady cooks, before sitting down to a generous lunch.

CHATTI PATHIRI 
A 12-layered baked pancake interspersed with eggs, poppy seeds and raisins, each bite is a delicious crunch followed by luscious overtones of the ghee, caramelised sugar and the textural play of nuts. This is one dessert that‚Äôs a must-have here.
rs 25. (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

KALLUMAKAYA NIRACHATHU
Twice cooked, first the mussels are steamed in a rice cake with spices and then fried, the kallumakaya niracathu is a speciality at Zain‚Äôs. Peel the shell away to reveal the mussel, the rice cake is a tad crunchy to the bite and yet moist within, the flavour of the masala has seeped into the rice dumpling. 
rs 29. (usd 0.4) per piece
10/10

FISH FRY
Lightly coated with a masala that plays second fiddle to the flavours of the plump ayakora or kingfish, this fry snares the moist flakey-ness of the fish in a light crunch. The turmeric lends it a delightful golden-orange hue. 
rs 200. (usd 2.8) per piece
8.5/10

MUTTON STEW
Rich in coconut milk, this creamy stew carries within itself juicy chunks of meat that is yielding and flavourful. The tingling sensation of green chillies on the palate is balanced by the ripe acidity of the tomatoes. Best savoured with the ghee rice.
rs 250. (usd 3.5) per piece
10/10

GHEE RICE AND CHICKEN MASALA
The rich chicken masala makes for the perfect companion to the aromatic ghee rice. Rounding up the rich tones of the onions, tomatoes and curry leaves is the coconut oil that floats to the top of this dish, absorbing the flavours of the vivacious masala along the way. 
Chicken masala rs 150. (usd 2.1), ghee rice rs 60 (usd 0.8) 
8.5/10

CHICKEN BIRYANI
This isn't a biryani that jostles your tastebuds, it embraces your palate gently with light flavours of the fried onions and spices. The chicken is moist, having absorbed the flavours of the marinade as it cooks slowly over dum for an hour. The biryani exudes a hint of smokiness, and is almost buttery on the palate thanks to the ghee, oil and vanaspati that goes into the cooking of this biryani.
rs 150. (usd 2.1)
