Their signature dish is the fish fry, available in varieties like Gujole, Owlu, Katla, and Gowri, each offering a unique taste and texture. The masala coating the fish is the highlight, praised for its perfect blend of spices and tanginess. The fish curry, a coconut-based gravy, perfectly complements the Akki Roti, a crispy and toasted flatbread.  The highlight of Hotel Bhavani is its unique and flavourful masala used in both the fish fry and curry. This masala is specially crafted to enhance the freshwater fish's flavour, which inherently lacks the saltiness of sea fish.
