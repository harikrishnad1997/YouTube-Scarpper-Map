Working 18 hours a day, life was tough, he spent many nights with no roof over his head. Things got better, when he and his family set up two restaurants in Chennai. Unfortunately, the restaurants failed and they had to begin all over again. This is hardly the kind of backstory one would expect to hear of Chennai’s iconic Sangeetha vegetarian chain of restaurants. But these are exactly the kind of challenges Mr. Suresh and his family endured to build 50 restaurants over the years. I caught up with him at their flagship Adyar restaurant, where I relished a delightful Tamil Nadu meal which in addition to highlighting the cuisine of the land is also accommodative enough to encompass flavours beyond the borders of the state. \\n\\nI hope you enjoy my last saapad from this Gourmet On The Road, Chennai tour.

This video is a slightly lengthy watch, but one that should have you salivating for more.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this very special episode from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai.

Today though, Buhari is perhaps most famous as the place where the chicken 65 was invented. I tasted their creation and was surprised to find it unlike any other version that passes off as a dish.

Thus was born Harshini Condiments in a tiny bylane of Ravindra Nagar in Shimoga. The fare here is chaat but in a healthier avatar. Think ingredients like fresh fenugreek, banana stem, cabbage, pomegranate, corn, et al tossed together with savoury elements of crunch and punchy homemade chutneys.

When I called out for Shimoga, this restaurant received the most recommendations. And those in the know may not be surprised given the fact that Sri Meenakshi Bhavan has been an integral part, actually a pioneer of the city’s culinary landscape for over a century now. The space that it occupies was once the owning family’s ancestral abode and that energy also seems to permeate through the homely old-fashioned decor and the South Canara inspired fare here. The food is tasty, sumptuous and satisfying, made to traditional recipes by cooks, many who have served in the kitchens here for decades. Whilst the benne masala dosae may come as the most recommended dish, the vade, avalakki mosaru, paddu too are as rewarding as I found during a breakfast visit where I also had the opportunity to converse with the restaurant’s third generation owner, Mr Chandrashekar and his daughter, Ganavi.\\n\\nIf you are in Shimoga, or are making plans to visit, this is one eatery you must not miss.

Be it the masala puri, sev puri or paani puri, each one hits differently as I discovered during this outing to DVS Circle Pani Puri, a chaat shop that has held sway over the city’s penchant for its spicy fare for nearly four decades. I was told these unique flavours were a result of Shimoga’s purveyors not being influenced by chaat traditions of the North and therefore developing a unique palate of their own.

That’s when I chanced upon RNR donne biryani on a delivery app. I had never heard of them before, and so Intrigued, I ordered. And was pleasantly surprised with what I tasted, so much so that I even filmed an impromptu vlog. \\n\\nNow whilst most businesses that opened during this period to cater to consumers at home were unable to make it beyond the pandemic, RNR has not only survived but scaled across multiple kitchens (at last count there were 18!) in the city and also a couple of restaurants on the back of the popularity of its donne biryani that is made to a family recipe. In this episode I visit their newest restaurant in RT Nagar, Bengaluru, where I catch up with Ramya Ravi, co-owner of the chain, who articulates that “their vision is to take Bengaluru’s donne biryani offering across the country!” And going by what I witnessed during the step by step making of their signature chicken donne biryani, and also what I tasted, they certainly seem to be on the right path to doing so.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this biryani making episode.

He tried his hand at many a job and trade, barely managing to make ends meet. A couple of years ago, he set up a food cart in Banashankari, South Bengaluru on the back of non vegetarian recipes gleaned from his well wishers. This too met with limited success, it was at this point that he introduced a thatte keeping in mind the clientele in the area. And that was when things changed. His soft and spongy 15 rupee thatte idli served with butter and two delicious chutneys caught the attention of locals and demand grew to an extent that he gave up the non veg menu to only focus on the idli, vade and a single rice preparation. Unable to cope with the stream of customers, Channe Gowda eventually moved operations to a house in the area, from where he continues to serve hundreds of his now famous Kunigal thatte idli each day. \\nFrom a street cart that would barely support him, he now provides livelihood to a team of fifteen! I set out this evening to meet this hard-working gent, and in the course of doing so, not only tasted his satisfying idlis, but also stumbled upon a flavourful tomato rice that he makes to an aromatic biryani recipe.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this inspiring tiffin thindi outing.

Much as their fare - a smorgasbord of meaty regional Karnataka delicacies seemed interesting - we couldn’t explore it further as we rarely ever cover cloud kitchens. Emboldened by the interest from customers, the family eventually set up a small eatery to seat all of 10 in the setback of a building on New Bel Road, North Bengaluru. And this of course, provided me with just the excuse to make the trek to Kutumba Kitchen, meet the family and taste some of the dishes that have earned this small enterprise quite a few fans in a short span of time.\\n\\nHope you enjoy this one, please do your best to support deserving small businesses like this.

From the many suggestions I received, I picked this tiny shop in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru. What first drew me to Dose Of Davangere initially was the fact that they still roast the dosae over a wood-fired stove, a cooking tradition that is fast disappearing in cities. And their commitment to procuring unsalted village butter from Davanagere. All in all, I was rewarded with the best expression of a Davanagere dosae that I have tasted in Bengaluru thus far. If you love your butter drenched dosae, especially the original Davanagere kind, this is a must-visit! In fact, I would go as far as endorsing it as a must-try dosae when here in namma ooru!\\n\\nHope you enjoy this find; take care, stay safe and strong.

Over time, their food evolved to assimilate local produce and ingredients. Many of the ‘military’ eateries in and around Bengaluru trace their roots to this style of cooking, although the offerings of some have morphed beyond recognition. To find examples of this unique fare that is comparatively true to its origin, one has to travel a bit out of the city. Like this 70-year-old eating house that we discovered in Malur, a town located 50 kilometres from Bengaluru.

The people behind the eatery are extremely low profile, preferring to let their food do the talking, and therefore reluctant to let cameras in. Which is also why you may not have seen a single in depth video or feature on the place thus far. \\n\\nWe managed to get our cameras not only into the restaurant, but also deep in the kitchen where we took an in-depth look at the making of some of their iconic dishes, from the meaty curries to the terrific biryanis and fries. The best part we found at Hotel Aditya, not only is the food great, but so is the ambience that it is served in. Making it one of the very few local style non vegetarian restaurants where you can savour your meal in peace and air conditioned comfort too.\\n\\nIf you've been putting off tasting some great naati oota because of concerns of ambience and crowd, Hotel Aditya is certainly the place to dive into local non veg cuisine.

How one wishes things had turned out differently, but alas! He wore Karnataka on his sleeve, and part of his vision was to promote young talent in Kannada cinema, a role that is now being bravely carried forward by his wife, Ashwini Puneeth Rajkumar. And when I recently received a call from her inviting me to a conversation on Aachar & Co., a film made by a near-all-women-team led by Sindhu Sreenivasa Murthy, somewhere, I felt this would be an apt continuation of my conversation with Appu Sir. \\nWe met over a delicious South Canara lunch at New Modern Hotel, an appropriate venue given the film’s setting in Bengaluru of the sixties. We discussed the film, which promises to be a witty family entertainer, rich in its cinematic value, food, pickles, family, a lot more… and also basked in the warming memory of our dearest Appu, Puneeth Rajkumar.\\n\\nI am looking forward to watching the film, you should too.

In ingredients that she procures from the valley, to the brigade of wazas (cooks) from Srinagar who have made Bengaluru their home! To enjoy a meal here, park aside all notions you may have of the cuisine based on the odd so-called Kashmiri dish you may have tasted on a menu here and there. For the fare here is anything but that.\\nI opted for the maaz traem, a traditional celebratory meal and what followed was a procession of 12 dishes. From the initial methi maaz, soft and velvety tripe, served on a bed of rice, to a ghee-fried tabak maaz (ribs), dani phol (stewed lamb shanks) and a finely minced seekh kebab, to the hearty mains, rogan josh, the subtly flavoured sort you have never eaten before, rista (juicy meatballs), a comforting palak and razmah dal, creamy nadur (lotus stem) yakhni, marchewangan korma, the only searingly spicy dish of the lot, and gushtaba (meatballs stewed in yoghurt and dried mint), each preparation I found exquisite and subtly distinct in its flavour and taste. \\nIf you’re looking to try wazwan fare true to its roots, far removed from the ginger-garlic-chilli-cream infused heavy dishes that get passed off as Kashmiri elsewhere, definitely check out Sarposh restaurant and tea room in Bengaluru. \\n\\nHope you enjoy part two of my Sarposh outing.

Since this was a non vegetarian wazwan, we ordered the vegetarian dishes separately on a la carte basis, these are priced at Rs. 325.

A casual idea of staging a Kashmiri pop-up for a few friends ‘avalanched’ into a dinner for 1000 guests, compelling her to fly in wazas (Kashmiri cooks) to prepare the meal. Encouraged by the response, and her husband Azeem Syed, she embarked on setting up a space that sought to not only celebrate true Kashmiri cuisine, but also its culture and traditions. Thus was born Sarposh restaurant and tea room in Indiranagar, Bengaluru. Needless to say, the cooks (wazas) stayed back. I visited her for lunch one afternoon and was blown away by the sheer depth of cuisine and culture that this young entrepreneur seeks to showcase in her cozy dining space, which also offers a fascinating insight into the traditions of her land in its decor and artifacts. What was intended as a typical review lunch turned into an engrossing conversation with Azmat and her team, thereby resulting in this rare two-part Gourmet On The Road episode.

She began one and ran it for a few months, when tragedy struck, and her husband was no more. Left with no recourse to fend for her three children and herself, Sumathi Charles ploughed her entire savings into setting up a modest eatery serving Tamil Nadu style vegetarian tiffin and meals.

I have no doubt that if this eatery remains true to its cuisine philosophy, it will certainly emerge as a must-eat-at place on Bengaluru’s culinary trail.

Their little son fell seriously ill and to nurse him back to health, this young couple had to borrow a fair bit of money. However soon thereafter Mahi lost her job. Left with no recourse, she turned to her love for cooking and opened a small shop near her home in Akshayanagar, a distant suburb in South Bengaluru, where she serves Lucknowi biryani and kebabs made to her grandmother’s recipe at home. There’s only a table to seat four and a few regulars in the area who order takeaways. But business has been tough, and the young couple have been having a tough time trying to make ends meet and repay their loans. I received an appeal from Mahi, and after making discreet enquiries, visited them for a meal. While the tiny size of the shop, it’s no more than a kiosk, with a table outside to seat four, did surprise me, what floored me completely was the taste of the fare that is served out of Biryani Delicacy. I will definitely return for the biryani and the kebabs. And needless to say, you should visit too.

Fitting therefore that this coffee town is also home to a unique coffee store that offers customers an immersive walk through the history, brewing and experiential tasting of coffee. I visited World Of Coffee on a recent trip and tasted a host of coffee - new age artisan varieties like pineapple fermented, honey infused, foraged civet coffees, and traditional filter coffee. When in Chikmagalur, you must explore coffee and this store is a great place to start.\\n\\nHope you enjoy this heady brew of an episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!\\n\\nTasting:\\nEach of the coffees tasted left a mark. My favourites though, in descending order of preference - civet coffee, filter coffee, cold brew, fruit and honey infused coffee. And to taste coffee in a dessert form, the panna cotta is highly recommended.\\n\\nThe coffee panna cotta is priced at Rs. 170, and the artisan coffees around Rs. 170.\\n\\nKripal Amanna\\nGourmet On The Road & Founder, Food Lovers TV\\nPs.

Since then, a new highway has emerged that bypasses most such places. On a recent road trip to Chikmagalur though, I decided to stop at Hotel Parimala and rediscovered for myself a culinary institution that takes great pride in its age-old traditions that places great emphasis on serving quality fare to customers at prices that also seem to be an honest echo to the past.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy this episode enough to revisit old eateries like Hotel Parimala that have been bypassed by modern highways.

As the eatery became popular, his family also introduced their unique village style biryani along with other meaty preparations like the mutton sambar, thale kaalu and chops. He has since passed on, but his family continues his culinary traditions at SLR Biryani. Notwithstanding the recent construction of a flyover that bypasses this humble home eatery and has impacted business here, it still manages to hold on to its loyal patrons. The popularity of their wood-fire-cooked biryani is such that it runs out in a few hours each morning, after which it is the mutton dishes served with ragi mudde, plain rice or khushka that occupy centrestage. I dropped in impromptu for lunch one afternoon and was elated to find, through a tremendous stroke of luck, the biryani that was prepared for a special order.\\n\\nHope you enjoy this rustic episode.

He went on to open a tiny store in Vidyaranyapura, a far flung locality in North Bengaluru, 23 years ago, a place so remote that back then only a handful of buses would ply there each day. However today, the area has grown into a bustling suburb, and so has Hegde’s Fast Food which is now a cornerstone of the neighbourhood for its idli, vade and a couple of other thindi items.

Getting to Taufiq Dilpasand Biryani Point requires some effort given its location in the inner recesses of Galli Haveli Azam Khan, a bit of a walk from Jama Masjid. The shop itself is a little more than a window, but the biryani that emerges from the copper pots here has endeared itself to biryani lovers in the know for a quarter of a century now.

The fare at Ahmedia Hotel was mostly Mughlai,  inspired by the culinary traditions of erstwhile North Arcot principality. Over decades the kitchens here have perfected time-honored recipes, amongst them a wood-fire-cooked biryani that, unusual for Tamil Nadu, favours the basmati over seeraga samba rice. I discovered Ahmedia three years ago on a #gourmetontheroad tour through the region when I met the founder and his enterprising sons. Janab Ahmed Basha has passed on since, but his sons seem determined to build on their father’s legacy. And have now opened a massive 25,000 sq. ft., 250-seat Ahmedia branch on the Bengaluru Chennai highway with the conveniences required to cater to travellers. I visited them on a recent trip to Chennai, where I tasted most of my favourite dishes here, including the biryani that has put Vaniyambadi on the culinary map.\\n\\nHope you enjoy this episode.

A2B, as the group is popularly known, is now perhaps South India’s most recognised restaurant, sweets and snacks brand, with over 150 outlets across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and overseas, however its origins are rather humble and trace an agricultural family’s inspiring 60-year journey through Rajapalyam, Bengaluru, Chennai and beyond. As I learnt from the second and third generation of the Adyar Ananda Bhavan family when I visited their facility that can produce over 40,000 kilos of savouries and 10,000 kilos of sweets evry single day! \\n\\nWhat is heartening though is the family’s commitment to sourcing quality ingredients, even making their own ghee to ensure 100% purity, and fostering an environment where the skill and craft involved in making artisanal handmade sweets is also encouraged alongside automated production lines to meet the burgeoning demand for their sweets and savouries.

One of Bengaluru’s oldest eateries, Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan has not received the kind of recognition other eateries of its ilk have perhaps due to its location amidst the hustle and bustle of Balepete. The food here is prepared the old-fashioned way, not the sort that swims in rivers of ghee or is buried under mounds of butter, khoa, or other such dairy decadence. Which is good, especially if you want to indulge, sans any guilt, in its tasty South Canara fare, like many of its regular patrons, some who have been visiting for 50 years! I soak in some charming old-world vibe as I make a tasty meal of some of their must-try dishes including a scrumptious, very popular sagu dosae and perhaps the most impressionable sambar you will find in this city.

Padma Amma experimented with vegetarian topping combinations for days on end at her home, also sharpening her secret recipe for a piquant pizza sauce, a sprightly medley of herbs, spices, sour, sweet and heat. From a spiced-up Margherita to a Karnataka pizza that basically incorporates almost every ingredient she has available, Amma’s pizzas are slowly but surely gaining favour with the locals of Koramangala, South Bengaluru for her hygienic approach to using fresh quality ingredients and creating flavours of the sort that appeal to most mainstream palates.

He passed on shortly after, but his wife and brother in law have continued his work over decades, preserving the flavour and character of the food. From a shed, it is now a tiny eatery, sans any name board, where customers queue up for rustic, village style fare served on banana leaves off granite slabs that serve as benches and tables. A recent addition also includes a basic but functional family room. I caught up with my chef friend, Sushil Dwarkanath to explore the cooking here and also make a tasty meal of their mutton delicacies.

This time around, I tasted their ‘dumdaar’ North Indian meal, priced at only Rs. 95 and the sort that provides tasty, well balanced sustenance and notably without sitting heavy on the stomach and lulling diners into a state of slumber. Though limited in its price, the meal packs plenty, a nourishing lentil preparation, paneer curry, choice of breads, palav, freshly cut salads, raitha, a lassi and even a dessert in the form of a modestly-sized motichoor ladoo.

It is the last hat though that is relevant here. 16 years ago, he set up a makeshift shed to serve the famous Kyathasandra thatte Idli but away from the bustle of the main Tumkur highway, on a narrow village road leading to a tiny hamlet, Kesaramadu. Slowly but surely the popularity of his solitary village eatery grew for its thatte Idli, dosae and simple rustic lunch that came as a boon to the farming folks around. However, four years ago some customers recommended that he try roasting the Idli in ghee, and thus was born his, now-referred-to-as, Kesaramadu Roast Idli. Thatte idlis are steamed, cooled and then slow roasted on a dosae tawa with liberal lashings of ghee. Ten minutes later, the idlis take on a delicious, buttery crust that sends the palate into raptures brought on by molten streams of ghee. And it is this idli that seems to have put Gangadhar Idli Hotel, Kesaramadu, on the food lovers map! Hope you enjoy this rustic breakfast episode. Take care; stay safe and strong.

In a relatively short span of under four years, her restaurant has carved out a significant niche for itself with its offerings that are built around the promise of “tasty fare at prices that offer maximum value”. I step into Zamindar for lunch, to meet her and her family who now support her enterprise unflinchingly and also taste some of the signature biryanis like the Hyderabadi biryani, ulavacharu biryani, gongura biryani, and other dishes that are a hit with customers.

So, after a couple of unsuccessful years, he began making puffs, pies and chops, the sort of traditional fare that locals appreciate and love.

And so on our recent drive to Goa, we planned a lunch stop in this agricultural town in North Karnataka at Hotel Nartaki, the home of this iconic dish. Established 30 years ago by N Satish, a tailor turned restaurateur, in a tiny eatery that could only accommodate a few customers at a time. His wife would help him make the masala at home that he would cook into curries. Along the way, he came up with the concept of enne khaara largely to appease the spice-hungry tastebuds of the locals. The dish, in contrast to its fiery name, is a beautiful balance of flavours between the chilli heat (from a combination of 90% local Javannur chillies that also impart a striking colour to the dish, and 10% Guntur chillies) and the oil that rounds off all the sharp edges of the masala aided by the sourness of tomatoes. Mr N Satish has since passed on but the homemade tradition continues with his sons, Chetan and Chandan, in a much larger space today, aided by their mother and wives. If you love your meaty fare, Hotel Nartaki is certainly worth a visit, I would say even a detour should you be travelling in the area. I hope you enjoy this very special episode.

Nonetheless, we stepped into the kitchen to check what was available and found the remnants of a xacuti gravy that owner, Mahesh Parsekar’s mother prepares at home. The roasted spice aroma of the gravy was enticing, and so when Mahesh offered to cook a ros omelet with the gravy, I knew we had to try it. The weighty omelet was elevated a few notches by the aromatic flavours of the xacuti, and I definitely look forward to returning to Sai Anant Parra someday in the hope of tasting more of the traditional home cooked fare. Hope you enjoy this short vlog on a hidden Goa gem.

In those days, the denizens of (then) chilly Bangalore were hesitant to eat ice creams afraid they may fall ill, and thus began a long and arduous journey of educating people to appreciate and enjoy these frozen treats. The effort seems to have paid off over the years, making this vegetarian ice cream parlour a household name amongst old Bangaloreans. From multiple outlets, Mantap has now scaled back to only one store in Seshadripuram, where Mantapa Upadhyay, (as he is popularly known) dreams up combinations that he personally puts together each morning with dairy rich ice creams that are sourced from a premium ice cream supplier. In this conversation with him and his family, I savour a range of his delectable creations - from traditional pure organic jaggery, guava chilli, to inspirations like the fruit fusion, red velvet cake, and classics like rich mango cream and caramel, and a couple of delicious faloodas too.

It’s tough not to be taken in by its disarming ‘sussegad’ chilled-out vibe, the cheerful attitude of friendly Goans who welcome visitors with open arms, its vibrant culture and customs, and last but not the least, its food that is rich in its traditions, varied and flavourful. We stayed a week in Goa exploring its culinary fare, from meals in fabled, century-old institutions, to establishments that serve up a delightful showcase of community cuisine, Saraswat and Catholic, to uncovering some tiny unsung hole-in-the-wall joints, savoring street food and more. Stay tuned to Food Lovers TV over the next few weeks as we roll out these Goa episodes; each eatery featured a must-add to your next Goa visit. For now, here’s a preview of what’s in store.

And for his main ingredient, he chose the humble gobi, cauliflower, given the popularity of gobi manchurian, but in an avatar that had not been seen before. Experimenting with a spice mix he first made at home, Usman Dry Gobi emerged. It wasn't long before he moved to a street cart, and eventually a streetside stall a few years ago. Great care is taken by him and his son, Usman, to procure the right quality and size of cauliflowers, that are cleaned thoroughly and spiced with a secret masala, before being fried meticulously in a bath of hot oil. The result is the crunchiest, most flavourful dry gobi one can eat in Mysuru, and the sheer number of customers who queue up at this stall every evening stand testament to the fact that Usman’s Dry Gobi has emerged as one of this palace city’s most popular street food creations over the years.

He began his eatery cooking all dishes himself, wIth recipes gleaned subconsciously having watched his grandmother cook in his ancestral home in Hubli. Therefore, not surprisingly,  the flavours are the sort that one would find in a Savaji household in North Karnataka, the food cooked in a set up that quite resembles a home kitchen, not by professional chefs, but a small team of people who moved from Hubli to join Narasingsa. I step in here for a delicious meal of a sumptuous, mutton thali with the softest kaima unde, tasty chicken masala, mutton dry fry and other dishes. If you like your meaty preparations, albeit spicy, this is certainly a place to check out Savaji cuisine in Bengaluru.\\n\\nThis tiny eatery isnt easy to locate, hidden on the first floor of a nondescript building in a bylane of Rajajinagar.

A good representation of this culinary ethos is the jowar bhakri meal served at Kamat Bugle Rock in Basavanagudi. Part of the Kamat Yatri Niwas group that first brought North Karnataka cuisine to Bengaluru in a restaurant format, this 17-year-old eatery serves a satisfying jolada rotti oota, albeit with flavours slightly tweaked to better suit the palate of this South Bengaluru suburb.

Selling a limited variety of pure vegetarian breads, buns and biscuits, the bakery fell upon hard times due to the rationing of flour and other essentials in the seventies. Faced with dire prospects, Ramaswamy Iyengar looked at the plentiful groundnut for survival and in doing so hit upon a unique recipe combining peanuts with a blend of spices that he named the Congress kadlekai, owing to the legend that during British times, secret notes were sent by Indian National Congress party workers hidden in sacks of groundnuts. I spent an afternoon with the second and third generation of the Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery family to watch the making of the iconic Congress kadlekai and also taste some of the traditional items that make this 66-year-old institution a hit not just with locals, but also with Bengaluru diaspora across the globe who throng here for the kadlekai, nippat, khara buns, palya buns, puffs and other traditional Iyengar bakery treats. \\n\\nKBC\\nRs. 35 (usd 0.5)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nPalya bun\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n9.5/10\\n\\nCapsicum puff\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n9/10\\n\\nBaked nippat\\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) for a pack of 10\\n8/10\\n\\nCongress kadlekai\\n10/10\\nRs. 440  (usd 5.9) per kilo\\n\\nBonda kadalebeeja\\n8/10\\nRs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo\\n\\nKadale fry\\n8/10\\nRs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo\\n\\nPepper kadlekai\\n8.5/10\\nRs. 400 (usd 5.4) per kilo\\n\\nHoney cake\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n7.5/10\\n\\nHappy Eating!\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nSubscribe To our second channel at https://www.youtube.com/c/KripalAmannaVlogs \\n\\nADDRESS - Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery (Old outlet), Building, Shop No. 125, 1st Floor Abalashram, DVG Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004, tel:- +91 78299 01153\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/boZgDF7EWCiF7jZc7   \\nTIMINGS - 9am to 9pm \\n\\nSreenivasa Brahmins Bakery (New outlet),opposite to Dodda Ganesha temple,\\nBull Temple Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560019, tel:- +91 78299 01153\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/VVeU416Yzv5sxjPC8    \\nTIMINGS - 830am to 9pm \\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

Unfortunately, that wasn’t to be owing to an accident, necessitating him to switch tracks to a corporate career. However, after 11 years, he decided to return to his love for momos in 2010 and set up a tiny 100 sq. ft. shop in RT Nagar, North Bengaluru to serve the freshest momos. How fresh? Unlike typical momo shops which pre-cook and reheat momos to serve customers instantly, out here these steamed dumplings are prepared from scratch, from rolling out the dough to preparing the filling, only when an order is placed. This approach has won for Ronald a steady stream of customers over the years, facilitating his shop’s move to a slightly larger space.

Eventually he moved to Rajajinagar in 1970 before opening a second bakery on Chord Road, West Bengaluru. What makes Variar bakery immensely popular with locals is its philosophy that “excludes artificial additives, preservatives and chemically bleached flour in its vast range of baked products.” As a result, “there is no shining in our items,” says second generation owner, Vijaya Shankar, who is currently on a quest to substitute, to the extent possible, detrimental fats with healthier options of unrefined oil, ghee, butter across most of their range, and in certain products, maida with wholewheat flour and grains. I spent the better part of a day exploring the bakery and tasting many of the must-haves at this institution that has spawned many imitators. Hope you enjoy this slightly extended, but toothsome watch. Take care; stay safe and strong.

Travellers would stop here for a few minutes and if hungry, would saunter off to one of the few home eateries on this remote, narrow strip of highway. And perhaps because its quick batter, water-like in its consistency, required almost no prep when an unexpected guest walked in, the neer dosae (neer meaning ‘water’ in kannada) quickly became the staple offering of this village centered around a bus stand. Whist many neer dosa stalls have mushroomed since, the oldest home eatery here is Anil Hotel, begun by Mrs. Mary 48 years ago and now managed by her son, Baby and his wife, Theresia. Famous for its honestly-priced homestyle curries, tasty preparations and warming hospitality that I first experienced a year ago, I learnt that the eatery was recently rebuilt after being demolished in highway expansion causing untold challenges to the family.

For very few, if at all any, in Kudla may have escaped to the alluring charm of the gadbad, tiramisu, parfait, bella candy and scores of other delicious ice cream creations concocted by S. Prabhakar Kamath, affectionately known as Pabba to family and friends, over half a century at his now iconic Mangalorean institution, Pabba’s and Ideal Ice Creams. On my visit to kudla nearly a couple of months ago, I had the opportunity to sit with him (after nearly 20 years), his son, Mukund, and grandson, Mohith, to taste their latest creation, the I. Thali, a tantalising ice cream take on the South Indian thali, at their newest parlour, Pabba’s Ideal Café, Bharath Mall, that seems to have taken Mangalore by storm going by the sheer numbers that queue outside this large restaurant. However little did I know then, that this would be my last meeting with him! This episode was conceived as a review of the I Thali, but is now in some ways a tribute to the man who put Mangalore and his legendary ice creams on the culinary map. \\n\\nTake care, stay safe and strong.

The must-try (actually one of only three items on the menu) here is the scrumptious Tuppa Dosae, roasted with liberal lashings of ‘vanaspati’ ghee, to accommodate “taste and budget” as pointed out by Mahesh. I dropped in for a quick chat and breakfast during a recent drive through the city. \\n\\nHope you enjoy this watch. I take this opportunity to wish you and your loved ones a blessed Deepavali.

Actually, it isn’t even a shop, but a window in 60-something-year-old Shivappa’s home from where he dispenses freshly steamed idlis (only) with home churned butter for a few hours each morning. Travellers on the route, and even those who journey from afar just to eat here, line up outside the window, even before it is flung open at 7am.\\n\\nShivappa’s enterprise bears no signboard and he employs no one, preferring to do everything himself, from preparing the chutney and the butter to the soaking and grinding of the grain, the fermentation and steaming of the idlis, helped only by his wife. When you are here, you need to abide by his “seemingly authoritarian” rules - register your order, collect a token in exchange for your payment, and wait patiently for Shivappa to steam the idlis fresh and call your token number! This may seem like a bit of a drill, until you take a bite of the spicy chutney soaked idlis, and then it all seems to make sense. Like we discovered when we drove 130 kilometres from Bengaluru for breakfast recently. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating. \\n\\nIdli Chutney Butter\\nRs. 30/ 40/ 60 (usd 0.1) for 4/ 6/ 8 idlis respectively.\\n9/10\\nRs. 10 for extra butter\\n\\nHappy Eating!\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 7am till 11am or until the idlis run out.\\nADDRESS -  Shivappa Idli Hotel, Jevargi - Chamarajanagar Rd, Darasaguppe, Karnataka 571435; tel: +91 99729 14888 \\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/mNoqcdBzvVnGBDFq7\\nNote: Shivappa’s Idli has no sign, the google maps coordinates bring you right at his door, where one usually sees people milling around a window.

Well, most begin as tentative experiments and over a period of time endear themselves to the palate of the locals. So much so that the denizens of the place become vocal ambassadors for the biryani. And when it comes to Belagavi (Belgaum), the Niyaaz biryani is one such icon. Made in the kacchi akhni style, in which semi-cooked rice is layered over twice-marinated meat and cooked on dum, the Niyaaz biryani is subtle in its character, owing to a unique blend of spices, and the light fragrance of a short-grain locally grown rice that is used in combination with the more typical long grain basmati rice. What began as a family’s endeavour to create a unique biryani 30 years ago is now unarguably one of Belagavi’s most popular dishes. In this episode, I drive to Belgaum to meet co-owner, Niyaaz Abdussalam Saudagar, and explore in depth the making of both the chicken and mutton biryani, before proceeding to make a meal of these distinct Belagavi culinary signatures.

And a popular chaat destination is Karnataka Bhel House, which began as one of the earliest stores unlike food carts way back in 1975. Founded by Mr Prabhulinga Linga Dev who converted his provision store in Chamrajpet to a chaat shop on the advice of a friend who had just returned from plying the trade in Mumbai, KBH, as it is popularly known, may have branched out into spiffy operations across multiple outlets today. However, it is the consistency of the chaats here, we are told by its fans, thanks to the owning family’s focus on sourcing the best ingredients, for instance, the peas that go into the masala come from the US to ensure the same taste year-round, whilst all components and condiments that go into the chaat are produced in their central kitchen, that has made Karnataka Bhel House a popular chaat destination. I visit the flagship Chamrajpet store to take a close look at this bustling operation, and also savour everything on the menu! Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong.

Whilst one will find a popular egg rice cart in almost every neighbourhood, there is perhaps none as popular as Snehajeevi Gowdara Adda Egg Rice, that thumps out enormous quantities to queues of patrons who wait patiently for the hot, spicy rice and other egg-y creations at this shop, ironically, located in the predominantly vegetarian neighbourhood of Malleshwaram. I dropped in one afternoon to take a closer look at this tasty creation and chat with the owner, Kumar Gowda, who began making egg rice in his pushcart 18 years ago when he was forced to give up the tender coconut trade.

After making a beginning in Chikkaballapur, the patriarch VA Venkatachalapathy Setty migrated to Bengaluru in 1952 to introduce the denizens of this city to his style of Mysore Pak, lush with ghee, and another equally popular invention, the Dumrote, a slow-baked crusty halwa made of ash gourd that takes the better part of a day to prepare. I catch up with the second, third and fourth generation of this iconic sweetmeat shop, and delve into the making of the Mysore Pak and Dumrote.

Against this backdrop, we were moved to hear of the struggles of a young engineering student who almost single handedly, with his mother, embarked upon a street cart venture to rescue his father and family from a crippling financial setback. And in the course of doing so, reconnected his father with a delicious North Karnataka snack tradition. In this street food episode, I stop by at Chitradurga Girmit Mandakki Centre to meet Ullas Basavaraju and his father, and also taste the Chitradurga mirchi in a scrumptiously delicious spicy avatar, some girmit mandakki masala and a rather intriguingly named ‘operation bajji’!

Which biryani should one try, should one try the Mani Biryani or the Anand Biryani? How different are these biryanis? Or are they similar? Which one is spicy, which one is not? What goes into the making of these hugely popular biryanis? Which one came first? And more… \\n\\nIn this special Gourmet On The Road episode, we revisit these biryanis and compare side by side Hoskote’s most popular early morning biryanis, undoubtedly, in an attempt to answer many of the questions posed. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and happy eating! \\n\\nAnand Mutton Biryani \\nThe dominant flavours in this biryani are that of the fresh ingredients, the naati ginger, garlic, coriander,mint etc., followed by a veil of the aromatic spices. Every grain of rice is imbued with its flavours, and the meat is a combination of some soft, juicy pieces and some on the bone, that calls for a bit of effort to get to every bit of it, some fat included. The spicing is gentle and warm. \\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1) \\n9/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nThe only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that’s made in Mani’s home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one’s mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.\\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\\n9/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 6am to 930am on Tuesday, Friday and Sundays only.

       " {'title': 'Bengaluru’s SOFTEST IDLIS Takeaway| BRAHMINS’ COFFEE BAR | Idli, Vada, Chowchow Bath | Rerun Episode',\n",
       "  'description': '#brahminscoffeebar #idlivada #bangalore\\n\\nsupport local eateries, takeaway south indian breakfast, brahmins’ coffee bar, idli, vada, chutney, kesari bath, khara bath, shankarapura, bangalore, bengaluru\\n\\nWhen it comes to soft, melt-in-the mouth idlis, all roads lead to Brahmins’ Coffee Bar idlis, or at least it did until the current situation. I visit this modest South Bengaluru eatery that’s big on its reputation to see how they are coping with life post covid, and take back a parcel of their entire menu consisting of all of four items only! Are the idlis still as soft? Well, you’ll have to watch this one to find out. Stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please support local eateries.\\n\\nTakeaway Dish Review\\n\\nIdli\\nA coarse-grained porous idli that allows for the chutney to seep in, you can taste a slight tartness from the fermentation. With the spicy ghatti chutney, that is made of hurukadale, roasted Bengal gram, coconut and  the idli takes on a bold, flavourful avatar. Pour the ‘telu’ or ‘flowy’ mint-coconut chutney over the idli to make for a bite that melts in the mouth.\\nRs. 34 (usd 0.45) for 2 idlis \\n \\nUddina Vade\\nIt’s a tough act for the vade to follow the idli in takeaway mode, given that the vade is best savoured hot and crispy. However, a saving grace here is the vade is studded with curry leaves, green chillies, peppercorns, fresh coconut, thereby making for a flavourful bite. Soak up the past-warm vade with the chutney to relish the warming heat from the green chillies in the chutney. \\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) per vade\\n\\nKhara Bath\\nBCB’s khara bath is a flavourful one, embellished with curry leaves, toasted lentils, mustard seeds, grated coconut, coriander, tasty enough to be savoured sans the chutney. But if you like it spicy, go ahead and introduce it to the zesty gatti chutney. \\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \\n\\nKesari Bath\\nEnd your takeaway tiffin with the kesari bath! There’s tonnes of ghee that goes into this sweet semolina and vermicelli concoction and you can taste it in its lush richness. The flavours draw from the tangy fruitiness of the pineapple and the warming cloves. The plum raisins add a sugary pop when you bite into one. \\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \\n\\nNote: I haven’t rated these as I feel it would be unfair to rate South Indian breakfast items in a takeaway format. Since this is a rerun episode, prices of the dishes may have changed since.\\n\\nBrahmins’ Coffee Bar is open only in the mornings from 6am to 1030am presently.\\nADDRESS -  Near Shankar Mutt, Ranga Rao Rd, Shankarapura, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004; tel +91 98450 30234\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/bZat92ZaSkeRCVyJA\\n\\nBrahmins’ Coffee Bar Previous Video Link: https://youtu.be/3tvWL9eJQRM\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

       " {'title': 'Iconic MAVALLI TIFFIN ROOM Veg Lunch Evolves For Takeaway! Rava Idli, Masala Dosa |  Rerun Episode',\n",
       "  'description': '#mtr #vegetarian #supportlocal\\n\\nsupport local eateries, takeaway, mtr, mavalli tiffin rooms, lalbagh, vegetarian lunch, thaali, rava idli, masala dosa, hema malini maiya, bangalore, bengaluru\\n\\nStep into Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, the city’s oldest eatery, In this throwback episode to see how they have evolved their popular 21-item traditional lunch to a more convenient and packaging-friendly 9-dish mini-meal. \\n\\nFrom revamped, sanitised processes to consolidated menus, this century-old institution is revamping and reworking processes to meet the needs of the current situation. But then, that shouldn’t come as a surprise, because after all, they do have a tradition of innovating through adversities in the past, as illustrated in the invention of the rava idli during the rice famine of the 40s, or the seed for MTR packaged foods that was sown during the 1975-77 emergency. \\n\\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.\\n\\nMini Meals\\nNo longer the enormous spread that would be a delicious gateway to a post-lunch slumber, the mini meals is compact in its post-covid avatar. But that doesnt get in the way of making for a satisfying lunch, puri, saagu, rice, rasam, palya, mosaru anna, poppadom, uppinakayi and payasam, the mini meal has all that you need to savour a taste of Mavalli Tiffin Room. \\nRs. 162 (usd 2.1) \\n8/10\\n\\nMasala Dose\\nAlthough packed in a foil-lined box, the masala dose is missing its crunch in takeaway mode, understandably, as opposed to when savoured at the restaurant. You can heat it on a tava with a dollop of ghee to make some amends, and the flavours are trademark MTR, the sprightly chutney smeared inside the dosa and the flavourful, bright aloogadde palya. The chutney is rich in coconut and green chilli spice. All in all, makes for a delicious takeaway dose, once you get past the expectation of eating something crisp.   \\nRs. 90 (usd 1.2)\\n\\nRava Idli\\nA dish born of a crisis, the rava idli is said to have been invented in the kitchens of Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, when there was a shortage of rice during the famine of the 40s. This is a flavourful rava idli that is rich in yoghurt, embellished with coriander, mint, coconut and topped with toasted cashew, and does spectacularly well as a takeaway. The aloogadde sagu serves well to moisten the idli with its savoury character. \\nRs. 60 (usd 0.8)\\n\\nADDRESS -  Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, #14, Lal Bagh Main Rd, Doddamavalli, Sudhama Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560027; tel +91 80 2222 0022\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/546tf138essAZYnT7\\nTakeaway available at all MTR outlets.\\n\\nPrevious video links:\\nMOST POPULAR Bangalore BREAKFAST At MAVALLI TIFFIN ROOMS https://youtu.be/L-knGepV3UE\\nExploring Traditions & Tasting the VEGETARIAN LUNCH THALI At Mavalli Tiffin Rooms https://youtu.be/awWIK8PuGR0 \\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

The food is staple Nagarjuna fare with creamy lentils pappu, nourishing sambar, tangy tomato rasam, teh customary koora or vegetable with all the mandatory accoutrements - pappulu podi, curd chillies, payasam, papad, pickle and more served with a humongous bucket of rice. \\nRs. 420 (usd 5.5) \\n8/10\\n\\nChicken Sholay Kebab\\nOne of Nagarjuna’s most popular boneless chicken appetisers is embellished with loads of curry leaves.

A tasty bite nonetheless. \\nRs. 305 (usd 4)\\n7/10\\n\\nChilly Chicken\\nThe chilli, spelt with a ‘y’ as opposed to an ‘i’ on the menu is as unique as the dish in itself. Not to be confused with the popular Sino-Indian version, this is Andhra’s ode to its love affair with the chilli.

However the current scenario calls for an entirely new approach in food service, and in keeping with this, this revered South Bengaluru eatery has embraced takeaway as a new way of life, at least for the foreseeable future. I visit Vidyarthi Bhavan to document this change from the past and see for myself how its management is taking all steps necessary to ensure continuity of its delicious culinary traditions in as safe a manner as possible. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.\\n\\n\\nMasala Dosa\\nThe masala dose is now folded twice as opposed to the VB classic one fold, an allowance that the eatery has made for the dose to be rolled into an aluminium foil in order to retain its temperature when savoured at home. The crispy crackle of the dose is now replaced by a whisper of a crunch, but the buttery flavours are still spot on. The dose oozes ghee, and the aloogadde palya is mildly seasoned and creamy. It helps to crispen the dose a bit on the pan just before eating. \\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) \\n\\nIdli\\nVB’s idlis are the grainy sort, perfect for ladling over chutney and piping hot sambar, before breaking it down to a delicious, spicy mash. If they’re too cold by the time they get to you, steam for a couple of minutes.\\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \\n\\nUddin Vade\\nThe vade definitely suffers the most casualty when consumed in a takeaway format. Gone is its crisp crunch, that would yield to a porous bite. The only way to redeem the vada is to dunk it into a bowl of piping hot sambar and savour it with a dollop of spicy chutney.\\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \\n\\nKhara Bath\\nThe kharabath travels extremely well, given its moist texture. This tasty dish is studded with onions, fried lentils, coconut flakes and curry leaves, making for a playful medley of flavours and textures.\\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \\n\\nKesari Bath\\nEnd your meal with this luscious semolina preparation, the flavour of the pineapple and cloves is quite pronounced. The dish is mellow in its sweetness, save for the pop of extra sweetness when you bite into a toasted raisin.\\nRs. 26 (usd 0.3) \\n\\nNote: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available.

The pandemic had quite literally taken the wind out of their enterprise, a tiny 3-table eatery in a nook of South Bengaluru where Mr. Mohammed and his son would sell the biryani made by his wife at home. However, the sincerity with which this affectionate couple shared the making of the biryani in our video seems to have won for Noon’s Biryani legions of fans resulting in a new lease of life for this neighbourhood shop that now has customers across India, with requests from overseas patrons too for their special biryani spice blend. I caught up with them for a quick chat a few weeks ago when I popped into their store to take away some biryani, and also left with a healthy dollop of inspiration based on what the family had managed to achieve notwithstanding the current challenges of life. I hope you enjoy this impromptu inspiring vlog, take care, stay safe and happy eating.\\n\\nif possible, please spare a thought for the many neighbourhood restaurants and eateries that have given us abundant culinary pleasures and now depend on our support to make it through these gloomy days, one small takeaway order at a time. \\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: lunch - 1pm to 4pm; dinner - 630pm to 10pm\\nNote: Closed on Mondays; they make the mutton biryani only on weekends.

In this throwback takeaway biryani review, we visited Meghana Foods, a establishment that seems to have a formidable following for its biryanis that are mostly made in the Hyderabadi style with loads of masala. Purists may balk at the eatery’s top seller, a boneless chicken biryani that to me seemed like a culinary intersection of Sino-Indian and Hyderabadi fare! Love it or hate it, you certainly can’t ignore Meghana Foods!\\n\\nAnd to allay consumer fears in a covid world, they seem to be following many of the practices - temperature checks, hand sanitation, sealed takeaway packs, etc. - that will have to be the norm when it comes to eating out. Hope you enjoy this one, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nNote: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support local eateries.\\n\\nSpecial Veg Biryani\\nA biryani that panders to a vegetarian’s biryani craving. The rice is flavourful, and the side of tossed vegetables draws clever inspiration from a mirchi ka salan in its flavours. \\nRs. 230 (usd 3) \\n8/10\\n\\nAloo Dum Biryani\\nThe potatoes are fried to a delicious brown and have absorbed the flavourful character of the fried onions and the spices. With the mildly spiced biryani rice, it makes for a tasty combination.\\nRs. 214 (usd 2.8) \\n7.5/10\\n\\nChicken Biryani\\nA biryani that is made in the traditional Hyderabadi style with loads of masala, this is the biryani to try here. The meat is juicy, moist and flavourful, cooked perfectly to the bone.\\nRs. 242 (usd 3.2) \\n8.5/10\\n\\nChicken Boneless Biryani\\nTender morsels of boneless meat, tossed in a spicy batter are served as an accompaniment to fluffy grains of biryani rice. Though a dish that is far removed from a traditional Hyderabadi biryani, it still commands legions of fans, I suspect partly because the spicy morsels of meat and generous portion of rice served makes it ideal for sharing. \\nRs. 248 (usd 3.3) \\n8/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nThe meat was a tad chewy and dry and lacking succulence, the rice though had a nice depth of flavour. Not a biryani that I would order again. \\nRs. 301 (usd 4) \\n7/10\\n\\nNote: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available.

Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.\\nSource: WHO https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200221-sitrep-32-covid-19.pdf\\n\\nFood containers and packaging. There's no evidence of anyone contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 after touching food containers and food packaging. Many restaurants are now offering no-contact takeout and delivery to lessen the risk of transmission.\\n\\nStill, if you're concerned, it's reasonable to follow general food safety guidelines. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water after handling takeout containers, and then transfer food to a clean dish using clean utensils. Wash your hands again before eating. After disposing of containers, clean and disinfect any surfaces that had takeout containers on them.\\nSource: Mayo Clinic, https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/expert-answers/can-coronavirus-spread-food-water/faq-20485479\\nFood Standards Australia & New Zealand, https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/safety/Pages/Can-COVID-19-be-transmitted-by-food-or-food-packaging.aspx\\n\\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease spreading from person to person.

So, with the support of her husband, Vijay Ananth, this soft-spoken lady ventured out as a restaurateur just a couple of months ago, and in a relatively short span of time has managed to make an impression on the neighbourhood with her rendition of Mangalorean-Kundapur fare laced with a touch of Kerala influence.

Narayan Rao, the late founder of Nani Hotel may have found it hard to fathom its current immense following that draws Bangaloreans to drive 50 kilometres for breakfast here. Having discovered its tiffin delights on a motorcycle ride a couple of months ago, I returned to savour breakfast, catch up with the owning family and patrons to find out what’s special here, including their much-loved Nani Hotel Masala Dosa. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care, stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nTuppa Masala Dosa\\nThe ghee masala dosa is the top draw with patrons here. Smeared with a spicy chutney as it roasts, the dosa is ladled with a dollop of potato palya and a top-up lashing of ghee to ensure the tuppa is what customers taste in plenty. The result is a golden-brown dosae that is slightly thick and biscuity in its crunch and lush with ghee, cradling within its fold a creamy, flavourful palya.

And spearheading this unique ‘nostalgic’ culinary initiative is Chef Regi Mathew, who has spent more than a decade extensively touring his home state, exploring recipes and connecting with cooks across homes, community kitchens, and even toddy shops. The resulting food is a labour of love, with ingredients sourced from micro-regions in Kerala to match the provenance of the dish, for instance the rice for the fabled Ramassery Idli comes from Palakkad, the home of the idli, the karimeen (pearl spot fish) from Vaikom, Kottayam, and so on… This fastidious approach to sourcing also seems to extend to the kitchen hands at KCK too, who hail from traditional kitchens and homes in ‘God’s own country’. In this episode, I partake of a lavish lunch that spans across a dozen preparations, made possible by their innovative menu approach that allows for diners to savour a string of delicacies in the course of a meal. Hope you enjoy this one, take care, stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nNote:\\nThe set menus at Kappa Chakka Kandhari are priced upwards of Rs. 475 (usd 6.5) and in addition to a tasting of seven preparations, include a beverage and dessert too. Additional add-ons (limited servings), kappa vada, koorka fry, ramassery idli with chicken curry, are priced at Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) per dish.  \\n\\nRajayogi Meal\\nA set menu that’s fit for a king, this smorgasbord of a dozen dishes is sheer indulgence! Begin with juicy prawns in a coconut-kokum masala that is steamed in a petite banana leaf pouch, spicy ‘touchings’ of needle fish, the plumpest soft shell crabs, and a delicately flavoured pearl spot fish draped in a robust, toddy shop masala, amongst other delicacies that include a peppery chicken peralan and a slow-cooked mutton coconut fry. After an interlude of a sweet, sour and spicy, pineapple-nendram relish, the main courses troop out - pidi, tiny rice dumplings steeped in coconut milk and served with a flavourful simple chicken curry, a velvety mutton stew and appam combo, and a prawn puttu biryani that hits the spot. For dessert, there’s much to choose from, we tried the chilli-pricking kandhari ice cream and the luscious tender-coconut cloud pudding.\\nRs. 1475 (usd 20.3)       \\n9/10 (overall) The pearl spot fry, mutton fry, soft shell crab, pineapple nendram relish, mutton fry, appam and stew  - 10/10\\n\\nKappa Vada\\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) add-on serving\\n8/10\\n\\nKoorka Fry \\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) add-on serving\\n8/10\\n\\nRamassery Idli With Varutharacha Chicken Curry & Sambar\\nThe idli is aromatic and soft, slightly pasty, and has a bit of a weight that lends to combining with the sambar or spicy chicken curry.  \\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) add-on serving\\n9/10\\n\\nAyakora Nellikai Masala Fry\\nA fish fry inspired by frugal tribal traditions, the fish is spiced with a paste of sun-dried gooseberries, green peppercorn and kandhari, bird’s eye chilli.

Not just a generic version as dished out by fast food chains! Instead, he dug deep into his experience as a culinary student in Southern Italy, to open a pizzeria serving Sicilian style pizzas in his erstwhile North Bengaluru café in Yelahanka New Town. Siddy’s Pizza, as I discovered during a leisurely visit, is a one-man passion enterprise, where Siddy, as Siddhanth is known, does everything from taking the order to putting together the pizzas to serving customers who quite often chat with him as the cheese-laden flavourful pies bake in the oven.

I visited this modest eatery set in the ground floor of their home in the suburb of Brookefield, where I not only savoured a delicious Andhra Bhojanam but also caught the making of an iconic Nellore Chepala Pulusu, a sour and spicy fish curry.

The stall would travel from village fair to village fair selling mithai and khaara made of pure country ghee. 72 years on, village ghee may no longer be easily available, but Suresh Chikkananjundappa, his grandson, tends to the traditions of his ancestors in the ghee sweets and savouries that he personally prepares with his family and dedicated workers. Their mysore pak is hugely popular, made to a special technique where the gram flour is lightly roasted with some ghee, before finding its way into the paaka or sugar mixture. However, the tuppa jilebi, with the batter fermented overnight in clay pots, the rich badam halwa made with homemade khoa, and a seriously addictive red rice avalakki mixture, all made with pure ghee, are also must-haves when at this tiny sweet shop. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nTuppa Jilebi\\nMade of a batter that is fermented overnight in a clay pot, and fried in pure ghee, the result is a white jilebi that crackles with a sticky bite and unburdens its ghee-laden sweetness with just a tinge of sourness. \\nRs. 440 (usd 6) per kilo \\n9/10 \\n\\nTuppa Avalakki\\nRed rice puffed to a crisp in a bath of boiling ghee, comes together with ghee-roasted cashewnuts, curry leaves, Bengal gram and generous sprinkling of spices to make a seriously addictive khaara or mixture.  \\nRs. 560 (usd 7.7) per kilo \\n9/10 \\n\\nMysore Pak\\nSoft and crumbly, lush with ghee, this is the sort of Mysore Pak that dissolves on the palate with the light lilt of cardamom, when fresh. You can taste the weight of the gram flour, especially in the tiny clumps that have held on to the ghee as the gram flour is lightly roasted before it finds its way into the sugar syrup or paaka. The hero ingredient in this mithai though is the ghee that makes it Sri Chikkaveerana’s most popular mithai for over seven decades.\\nRs. 560 (usd 7.7) per kilo \\n10/10 \\n\\nBene Murukku\\nOne of the few items here that is made in oil, the murukku though crunchy and flavourful with cumin and carom seeds and the nuttiness of sesame, feels a bit spartan when tasted in the company of the other heavyweights here.\\nRs. 280 (usd 3.8) per kilo \\n8/10 \\n\\nBadam Halwa\\nGarnished with chironji seeds and slivers of pistachio and almonds, the halwa is rich with the reduced milk solid, ghee and the grainy bite of coarsely ground almonds. Although, the Mysore Pak is traditionally more popular here, the badam halwa comes a close second. \\nRs. 640 (usd 8.7) per kilo \\n9.5/10 \\n\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 1030am to 9pm \\nNote: They have no branches, to taste what I tasted, visit the original shop located in Vijayapura town by following the google coordinates given below.

Entirely self-taught, Mrs. Khanum serves up a repertoire of Hyderabadi-Mughlai dishes, assisted by her husband and children.

It is heartening to note though that the food remains as traditional as ever, in fact, with some ‘new’ additions seeking to convey to diners the wholesome flavours of the good old days. On a recent drive to Mysuru, I stopped by for a delicious breakfast of nourishing porridge, kuchalakki (boiled rice) ganji, tenginkai haalu (coconut milk) ganji, ragi (finger millet) ambli, and also tasted a scrumptious neer dosa made of the very special Rajamudi rice, and their much-favoured kotte kadubu.

The dose is roasted with generous lashings of ghee, ensure you ask for your dose to be kadak.

Bit by bit, the reputation of his food grew, and after 20 years of eking out a living on the streets, Lakshman was finally able to move into a tiny shop where customers could finally dine away from the bustle of the street.

A delicious one though seems to be that of going for a long walk around Kukkarahalli lake followed by a steaming, hot breakfast at a food rickshaw, Upahara Darshini, popularly known as Deepu Gaadi. The popular draw here is the set masala, smaller than your usual dosa, perhaps to let its fans indulge in more than one of these scrumptious beauties.

It is the meat of an indigenous variety of sheep that hails from Bandur, a village located between Malavalli and Bannur near Mysuru. Prized for its juicy tender meat, the sheep was traditionally sold in village shanties in Bannur, ergo the acquired moniker, Bannur. I drove to Bannur to learn more about this sheep and also catch a mutton meal at a family eatery, Bannur Ramaswami Military Hotel, that showcases this very special meat in its homestyle preparations. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating! \\n\\nNati Koli Kurma\\nThe chicken has a bit of a chew, a character of the free range chicken, there’s a bit of skin too that adds to the flavourful character of the homestyle curry, which is the sort that goes well with the ragi mudde.\\nRs. 110 (usd 1.5) \\n8/10\\n\\nKaima Sambar\\nDumplings of rough-ground mutton simmered in a curry, the meat has a springy bite to it.

The curry isn't too spicy, and is quite happy playing second fiddle to the flavour of the meat.\\nRs. 150 (usd 2.1) \\n8.5/10\\n\\nBannur Mutton Biryani\\nYou can nose the kasoori methi (dried fenugreek) in the aroma of the biryani, there’s the warming heat of the red chillies and spices that you can taste on the palate, a touch of tang from the tomatoes… the kolam rice is tasty all in itself, also having absorbed the character of the meat. The meat is soft and moist, deep pink in its colour and veined with fat. This is a biryani you should eat hot, do not allow it to cool down for the fat tends to congeal. \\nRs. 160 (usd 2.2) \\n9/10 \\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 9am to 11pm\\nNote: Like with most popular eateries, this one too has its share of imitators.

Half a century on, Mr. Ramchandra has remained steadfast to his father’s culinary tradition, steaming fragrant idlis over a wood fire. A one-man army, he procures the ingredients, prepares the wood to fuel the decades-old stove, soaks the rice and lentils, grinds and carefully ferments the batter, before rising at 4am each morning to make a spicy chutney, and steam over 3000 idlis, 500 in a batch, that run out before noon! Working with the energy and enthusiasm that is hard to imagine in a modern-day sextagenarian, Ramchandra swears by the philosophy of “cheap and best”, in his words, selling four piping-hot idlis for only Rs. 10, or Rs. 2.50 a piece!

His fondness for food and his ability to recall the flavour of dishes from local eateries led him to set up a pushcart on the outskirts of Bengaluru, serving a self-taught village-style biryani. In the beginning, “things were difficult, sometimes humiliating and marked by periods of self-doubt”, recalls Raju, as he is popularly known. Giving up though wasn’t an option, driven also by the necessity to provide for his family. Slowly, the popularity of his mild-flavoured biryani served in cups of dried banana leaves, jonne, grew, and so did the scale of his enterprise. Today, this resilient entrepreneur’s Halli Jonne Biryani occupies prime real estate in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru, and is frequented by over 500 customers on any given day. I catch up with Raju as he makes the biryani before sitting down to a tasting of most of the dishes on the limited menu here. Hope you enjoy this episode.

You can taste the tingling heat of the green chilli, the freshness of the coriander and mint, the veil of fragrance from the spices register.

       " {'title': 'This Man ‘Invented’ The WHITE PAANI PURI! Tasting BANGARPET CHAAT At Ramesh Chit Chat In Bangarapet',\n",
       "  'description': \"#chaat #bangarapet #karnataka\\n\\nbangarpet chaat, chaat innovation, white paani, vegetarian, white paani puri, pani puri, masala puri, sev puri, bangarpet tikki, pot gulkand salad, pizza paani puri, street food, pani puri, bangarapet, kolar district, kolar gold fields, kgf, karnataka\\n\\nSon of R. Panduranga Setty, who is said to have begun the Bangarpet Chaat tradition in 1974 in Bangarapet, named so (Bangar = gold, pete = town) for its importance as a town that connected the erstwhile Kolar gold fields to Bengaluru, 80 kilometres away, young Ramesh, wasn’t happy just continuing with the family legacy. A desire to create something new led to the invention of the ‘white paani’, a clear liquid that though as innocuous-looking as water, packs a potent, spicy punch. And thus began the tradition of the Bangarpet Paani Puri, that has spawned a few hundred namesakes in Karnataka. Ramesh however continues to operate out of his tiny shop in a bylane in Bangarapet, serving customers personally and experimenting constantly to add to his spicy, tangy repertoire. I spend an evening with him, tasting his wares, and return impressed with his childlike enthusiasm that doesn’t seem to have waned in the least despite being in the business for nearly four decades, his latest creation, a pizza inspired paani puri! Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nWhite Paani Puri\\nA simple assemblage of green peas, onions, carrots and coriander, stuffed in a semolina and flour puri, topped with the potent ‘white paani’. The spiciness of paani though is toned down by the creaminess of the peas and the crunch of the onions. A simple, clean flavoured paani puri that allows one to appreciate every component singularly, as well as in its completeness. \\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nSpecial Dahi Puri\\nEmbellished with rose petals, this chaat is a riot of flavours and textures. The crispiness of the chaat components and the spice of the masala play second fiddle to the creamy, sweet richness of the yoghurt that is fortified with Horlicks, milk powder and sugar. \\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7)\\n10/10\\n\\nFloating Paani Puri\\nThe floating paani puri is a spicy affair, the spicy white paani goes into the puri and also floats the puri. The moist crispness of the puri is endearing as is the crunch of the spiced peanuts and the sev, despite the fresh crunch of the onion, cucumber and tomato, there is no getting away from the chilli heat of the sea of white paani. \\nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\\n9.5/10\\n\\nTikki Masala Bangarpet\\nA take on the Bengaluru masala puri, this is puri topped with spicy chutney, sweet chutney, peas, garam masala, squeeze of lime, onions, carrots, coriander, sev and puffed rice. It has all the components that you would expect to find in a chaat without being overdressed! \\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nSpecial Sev Puri\\nThe flat papdi base for this chaat is fried in ghee which gives it a rich, ‘biscuity’ bite embellished with the nuttiness of sesame seeds. You can taste the edge of garlic in the chutney that the fresh ingredients are tossed in. \\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7)\\n9/10\\n\\nBhelpuri\\nA typical bhel but with the addition of the peas gravy that goes into every plat of chaat here, I found this rendered the puffed rice soggy and that didn’t quite work for me.\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n7/10\\n\\nPizza Paani Puri\\nI doff my hat to Ramesh on his latest attempt to innovate and bring a foreign flavour to the bylanes of Bangarapet. However, with regards to its taste and appeal, some may fancy it, yet others question its existence. \\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4)\\n7/10\\n\\nSpiced Amla\\nRs. 30\\n7/10\\n\\nPot Gulkand Salad\\nRs. 30\\n8/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 4pm to 10pm\\nNote:\\nADDRESS -  Ramesh Chit Chat, Vijayanagar Road, near nandhi medical, Vivekanand Nagar, Bangarapet, Karnataka 563114; tel: +91 94481 85272\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/s93eS1YseBT6Sdoy7\\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV.

Facing financial difficulty, a chance encounter with a visiting relative at an exhibition who was looking for food to be catered led to the couple setting up a home-cooked meal enterprise. A family-run operation, they would shop, cook and deliver the food themselves, with their children lending a hand with the chores too.  However, work from home and the current situation bought their livelihood to a standstill yet again! Not one to give up though, this family has set-up a small one-table eatery in the east Bengaluru neighbourhood of Kaggadasapura, primarily to serve as a takeaway point for their delicious home-cooked Rajasthani fare, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I drive here to chat with the couple, watch them cook a laal maas, sev tamatar and other dishes, before tucking into a delicious meal coupled with the warm hospitality of this Rajput family that has an inspiring, never-give-up attitude.

When they found none, she decided to quit her job and set up a small eatery that would endeavour to dish out the flavours of their favourite chola bhatura from Delhi. And so seasoned cooks were hired from Delhi, a complex 58-spice masala developed to ensure authenticity of taste, the right size of chickpea sourced to convey the flavour of the spices, et al. Barely had this enterprise found its feet early last year when covid struck! I made a surprise visit to Gopaljee Café one afternoon in response to a plea from the eatery. Suffice to say my conversation with this passionate lady entrepreneur and tasting of the puffy bhature and ‘mazedaar’ chole compelled us to return to film an episode of Gourmet On The Road. Hope you enjoy this one, enough to pay them a visit if possible. Stay safe and happy eating!  \\n\\nChole Bhature\\nThe bhatura is light and puffy yet with a bit of strength, to match the tenacity of the 56-spice blend masala that is delicately warming yet has enough depth to linger on the palate. The chickpeas, cocooned in the flavour of the masala, a seasoning of oil, chilli and spices, are stained deep brown by some amla and cooked such that they retain their shape yet yield in a creamy texture to the bite. The mandatory topping of dry, spiced aloo (potatoes) adds a slightly tangy flavour to the dish. If you like it spicy, go for generous bites of the green chilli pickle in between mouthfuls of the chole bhature. If you like paneer, opt for the paneer chole bhature, which arrives with a paneer and coriander mince, stuffed into the bhaturas, and also atop the chole.\\nRs. 100 (usd 1.4) per plate, plain \\nRs. 125 (usd 1.7) per plate, with paneer\\n9/10\\n\\nLassi\\nThe lassi is thick and creamy, garnished with nuts, and also provides cooling respite if you have ingested more of the green chilli than you can handle.\\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7) \\n8/10\\n\\nGulab Jamun\\nThe way to end your meal if you have a sweet tooth is with their perfectly browned gulab jamuns.\\nRs. 60 (usd 0.8) for two pieces\\n8/10 \\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 9am to 9pm\\nNote: The chole bhature are served between 9am and 830pm; the bhaturas are fried fresh upon order, so it may involve a bit of a wait especially if crowded.\\nADDRESS -  Gopaljee Café, 17/1,chandra mansion, Marathahalli - Sarjapur Rd, Bellandur, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560102; tel: +91 90350 03283/ 91081 71715\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/9DLhEGH91svQpPWc6\\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

       "  'description': \"#vegetarian #tiffin #bangalore\\n\\ntraditional vegetarian snacks from south canara, mangalore, kundapura in bengaluru, jagli tindi, jagli masala dosa, kotte kadubu, kolkatte, banana kesari bath, mandakki upakari, inspiring stories, couple goals, banashankari, south bengaluru \\n\\nAn engineer and mba by education respectively, Raksha Prasad and Suhas Karanth began making plans to open an eatery that would serve traditional vegetarian tiffin of their native South Canara, during their courting days. Shortly after getting married, they gave up their MNC jobs and their eatery, Jagli Tindi was born, in a tiny nook in Kengeri, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, with a menu comprising mostly dishes gleaned from their grandma’s recipes, with ingredients sourced from Kundapura to lend authenticity to the taste. Two years on, this passion enterprise has moved to a slightly larger space in Banashankari, South Bengaluru, but the couple still remain hands-on, Suhas, in the kitchen, and Raksha managing the front of the house. I visit them to learn of their inspiring story, catch some of the action in the kitchen, before sitting down to a slightly indulgent tiffin session. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\\n \\nMandakki Upakari\\nMade with a red puffed rice that’s tossed with their ‘secret’ podi mix and onions, topped with grated coconut and plenty of peanuts. This is the sort of fun snack that one should share with friends whilst you wait for some of the other substantial tiffin items.\\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\\n8/10\\n\\nKotte Kadubu \\nThe kotte kadubu here is made the traditional way, steamed in cups fashioned of jackfruit leaves that lends the kadubu a distinct aroma. There’s a hint of tartness from the fermentation, the red tomato chutney makes for a sprightly partner to the gentle flavoured kadubu, with its tangy, slightly spice, sour and nutty character. The vegetable sagu adds to the nutritional quotient of this tasty tiffin.\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n9/10\\n\\nJagli Masala Dosa\\nThis creation of Suhas Karanth seems to be inspired by the 99-variety dosa ilk. The dosa is smeared with a paste of potatoes, spicy podi and ghee, as it is roasted to a crisp on the tava. Folded, flattened and cut into two, this dosa creation makes for an interesting snack if you are the sort who is acquiesce to pushing the envelope for what a masala dosa can be.   \\nRs. 58 (usd 0.8)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nKolkatte\\nSteamed in a banana leaf, this steamed dumpling of urad dal batter, is stained lightly with the colour of the leaf. Slightly pasty and dense in its texture, and studded with whole peppercorns that lend their tingling touch. Whilst the red chutney adds zing, next time, I would also ask for some of the nutritious vegetable saagu to complement the austerity of this steamed dumpling.\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nBanana Kesari Bath\\nThe ripe banana heroes this velvety-textured dish from the start to finish, definitely order a plate of this to close your tindi experience here.\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3)\\n9/10\\n\\nCoffee\\nRs. 10 (usd 0.1)\\n8/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 7am to 9pm\\nNote: This is a relatively young enterprise, please support them with your patience in case of a delay because of the response from this video.

Like this delicious lunch that we savoured at  this popular eatery in Hassan, 210 kms from Bengaluru, a couple of months ago. Guided by suggestions from our viewers, I didn't quite know what to expect when I walked into a bustling lunch session here late one afternoon on our way back from Mangalore. But the memory of the rustic, homestyle Gowda dishes that I tasted here, lingers to this day. Suffice to say I would happily make the 210 km drive to Mamatha Hotel in a heartbeat just to savour the food all over again. Hope you enjoy the episode. I take this opportunity to wish you and your family a fabulous 2021. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\nKatla Fry\\nCoated in a delicious spiced batter that complements the earth flavours of the freshwater fish, the katla fry is a popular dish here for all the right reasons. The crispened skin and the masala work well to cradle the fleshy fish.\\nRs. 160 (usd 2.2) for 2 pieces\\n9/10\\n\\nMutton Korma\\nNotwithstanding bits of fat ribboned through it, the juicy chunks of meat have a bit of a bite. And as you chew on it, you are rewarded with the robust flavours of the curry. This is the sort of delicious mutton curry you would taste in a Gowda home in the area. Makes for a great accompaniment to the ragi mudde and steamed rice.\\nRs. 170 (usd 2.3) \\n9/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nFlecks of fat abound in this biryani, that is redolent with the aroma of mint and coriander, and do well to coat the zesty, hard-spice laced rice with its unctuousness. The meat is mild in its flavour and benefits from being combined with the rice.\\nRs. 210 (usd 2.9)\\n7.5/10\\n\\nChicken Leg Piece\\nThe chicken is tender and juicy, the masala has penetrated deep into the meat that is cooked through to the bone. The spicy batter that crumbs the chicken has depth of flavour that is quite endearing.\\nRs. 140 (usd 1.9) for 2 pieces \\n9/10\\n\\nChicken Fry\\nThe chicken pieces, in a slightly thick gravy, have bits of skin clinging to it.  \\nRs. 140 (usd 1.9)\\n7/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 1230pm to 10pm\\nNote: Sundays, 1230pm to 5pm; opt to sit upstairs, it is less crowded.\\nADDRESS -  Mamatha Hotel, Bangalore - Mangalore Rd, Beside Bhanu Theater, Karigowda Colony, Rangoli Halla, Hassan, Karnataka 573201; tel: +91 72599 23131\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/CR8dUgVM52ETGYgA8\\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

This meant foregoing a substantial chunk of revenues and relying on takeaway business only, but this was something they were prepared to live with, for the safety of their customers and staff. So when they reopened the eatery to customers a couple of weeks ago, we lost no time in getting there to savour their hugely popular donne biryani and also report on the current experience at this 90-year old culinary institution that has a reputation for being jam packed with customers. We arrived to find certain measures in place, even though in precarious danger of being overrun by its patrons. Thankfully though, the taste of the donne biryani hasn't wavered a bit from the time we tasted it last nearly a year ago.

This is the textbook donne biryani, served by this revered culinary institution for the last nine decades. \\nRs. 260 (usd 3.5)\\n10/10\\n\\nChilli Chicken\\nThe chicken is moist, bathed in a green chilli gravy, this is certainly not a dish for the faint-hearted. \\nRs. 180 (2.4)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nMutton Pepper Dry\\nTender meat braised in a deep roasted masala with plenty of pepper. \\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\\n9/10\\n\\nMutton Liver Fry\\nThe liver has a bit of a bite, its deep flavours juxtapose delightfully against the contrasting freshness of coriander and mint in the green masala.\\nRs. 160 (usd 2.2)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 10am to 4pm\\nNote: please call ahead to verify timings and dish availability on account of the current situation; closed on Mondays.  \\nADDRESS -  Shivaji Military Hotel, No. 718, 1st C Main, 45th Cross, 8th Block, Jayanagar, Bangalore 560 082; tel: +91 98451 49217\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/mZqgz8ZNB4C8e5s38\\n\\nLinks to videos mentioned:\\nBreakfast at SHIVAJI MILITARY HOTEL | Most Popular CHICKEN DONNE BIRYANI Making Revealed!

Legend has it that he would treat each customer as a guest visiting his home and leave no stone unturned in feeding them. Tales of his legendary hospitality and traditional fare soon spread far and wide and this tiny eatery evolved into the legendary Subbaiah Gari chain of restaurants. I visit their newly opened Bengaluru outpost where I explore the kitchen and the making of some special dishes before savouring a lavish 30-item banana leaf meal that is served with dollops of neyi (ghee) and old-fashioned hospitality that can leave you bursting at the seams!

The list of dishes served is far too long to be contained within this description, but suffice to say the food prepared by the master cooks who have trained in the original Kakinada Subbayya Gaari Hotel will hold your attention.

The result is Northwest Kebab & Curryhouse, a breezy casual dining restaurant in Koramangala, that is showcasing an interesting repertoire of dishes from the North West Frontier region. Barely a couple of weeks old, and with not too many customers at present, this is certainly an eatery to pencil into your eating-out plans if you are looking to taste “North Indian-style” of food that goes beyond the ubiquitous palak paneer and butter chicken!

The spicing is mellow, barring the tingling prick of heat when one bites into a peppercorn. The soft, layered warki paratha makes for a comforting companion to the Raja Bhojanam. If you’d like to add a touch of spice, savour this gravy with the chilli cheese naan, stuffed with mozzarella that bridges to the creamy flavour of the curry, and topped with finely chopped green chillies.\\nRs. 285 (usd 3.9)\\nWarki Paratha - Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)\\nChilli Cheese Naan - Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)\\n\\nVazhaipoo Murungakai Kozhambu\\nA ‘coconutty’ curry with fried banana blossoms and drumstick segments.

The year was 1992 and his hometown was Hoskote, then a mere highway halt enroute to Madras. Soon Mani began preparing and serving a rustic-style mutton ‘biryani’ inspired by his amma’s recipe. His early patrons, workers from nearby factories, truckers and drivers, for whom the biryani was a satisfying early morning meal to help sustain them through the day, having relished Mani’s biryani not only carried its taste but also news on this biryani shop. Year after year, the throng of customers to Mani’s eatery grew, and this also spawned the tradition of the early morning Hoskote biryani ritual with other biryani shops opening in its wake. Today Mani Dum Biryani Hoskote caters to hundreds of customers every Tuesday, Friday, and a few thousand on Sundays, but the rustic soul of the biryani remains, be it in the setting or the flavour of the dish, prepared only by Mani’s sons with a secret spice blend made by his wife. I drove out at dawn one Tuesday to watch the sons, Manjunath, Kiran Kumar and Chandrashekar prepare the biryani that first put Hoskote on the food lovers’ map. \\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nThe only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that’s made in Mani’s home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one’s mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.\\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\\n9/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: 6am to 930am on Tuesday, Friday and Sundays only.

But because cool drinks and ice creams weren’t popular in this sleepy South Canara town those days, the Pai family decided to diversify into snacks. Their first creation, a vegetable cutlet, then a foreign item to the Udupi populace, took nearly five years to curry favour with the locals. Along the way, they also accidentally conjured up an ice cream concoction, the Diana Gadbad. Whilst the early days may have been tough, these 60-year old timeless classics are the most popular items on the menu today. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nVegetable Cutlet\\nA potato and beetroot patty that is flavoured with a seasoning of curry leaves, lentils and spices, this cutlet is a delicious medley of flavours and textures.

And because it was prepared in a ‘gadibidi’ (kannada word for ‘hurry’) it came to be known as the Gadbad.

And it is no surprise given the fact that the brothers behind this tiffin house enterprise have over 125 years of combined experience in the making of the idli, vada and khara bath, beginning with extended stints at the iconic Brahmins’ Coffee Bar where they learnt the trade.

And then there are hundreds of tiny eateries that are almost unknown except to those they quietly provide daily sustenance to - office goers, working professionals, students yearning for a taste of home.... However, in the current scenario of work from home, offices and educational institutions being shut, these establishments that once were the lifeline of the communities they served are now finding it difficult to sustain themselves. \\n\\nIn this episode, I visit one such Bengaluru eatery, Polamma’s Mess, named so by its owner, Jagadeesh Reddy in memory of his late grandmother who raised him as an orphan in a village near Kalahasti, Andhra Pradesh. I hear his poignant account of how this once bustling eatery is barely getting by, which is rather unfortunate given the simple but delicious Andhra vegetarian bhojanam that Polamma’s serves in addition to other meaty sides. I hope you will find within your heart the desire to support eateries like Polamma’s Mess. These need your support today to help keep them on their feet to continue serving the workforce, students, community at large… when things get back to normal in the future. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\n\\nVeg Meals\\nMy favourite part of the meal here. Simple but satisfying affair of rice served with a nutritious and creamy ‘thottakoora’ pappu, vegetable for the day, sambar, rasam, yoghurt and the staple condiments of pappula podi, ghee and ghongura chutney. The simplicity of the meal is reminiscent of what you will be served in an Andhra home.\\nRs. 100 (usd 1.3)\\n8/10\\n\\nChicken Roast \\nThe chicken is double cooked, first in a deep-flavoured masala and then roasted in ghee with plenty of curry leaves and spices.

There is plenty of masala and the chicken is moist and juicy, made in the kacchi akhni style. A recipe picked up by Jagadeesh during his stint in Hyderabad.\\nRs. 150 (usd 2)\\n8/10\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: lunch - 12pm to 330pm; dinner - 7pm to 1030pm\\nNote: Only lunch service on Sundays; as you may have seen in the video this is a modest eatery sans any frills.

I visit this eatery that has the vibe of a busy dining hall to indulge in a humongous meal, and along the way also catch up with its unassuming owner, Vicky Pai, who says his trying experiences as a young executive looking for affordable, homestyle food in a new city, spurred him to open Machali - to serve tasty, homestyle food at affordable prices. And going by my meals at this eatery, I have visited thrice already, and watching fastidious Mangalorans relish the seafood here, Machali certainly delivers, whether one wants to enjoy a sumptuous fish meal and fry for Rs. 150 or splurge Rs. 300. Truly, a democratic seafood restaurant that caters to all.\\n\\nFish Thaali\\nA standard Mangalore fish meal experience, on the plate there is a fish curry with a small piece of fish, some dry vegetables on the side, boiled rice, shrimp chutney, fried sandige and pickle. Servers walk along ladling more fish curry, a simple Konkani style lentil preparation, daali thove, and rasam out of buckets. \\nRs. 60 (usd 0.8)\\n8/10\\n\\nTaru Buthai\\nTiny sardines, fried to delicious scrumptiousness, the sort that you eat whole. Quite tasty!\\nRs. 100 (usd 1.3)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nPrawn Fry\\nA robustly-flavoured fresh prawn preparation crusted in a Konkan koliwada masala. Once you get past the spices, you can taste the sweet lilt of the prawns.\\nRs. 230\\n8.5/10\\n\\nBoneless Crab Ghee Roast\\nPerfect for those who love crab but don’t want to go through the hassle of de-shelling one. The lush ghee roast masala packs a punch more so against the mild flavours of the crab, the buttery fervour of the ghee brings the spices and the crabmeat together. \\nRs. 280 (usd 3.8)\\n10/10\\n\\nSquid Ghee Roast\\nThe squid was cooked to the texture that yielded quite gently to the bite, the masala though, seemed a tad salty to my taste.

She would cook the biryani at home and her husband was entrusted with the task of selling these in supermarkets. Little by little, they grew their biryani business, moving to a tiny shop with space only for a counter and three tables eight years ago. Over time, the reputation of Noon’s Biryani grew and built for itself a loyal clientele, many of whom would order takeaways. However, the current situation has seen their business dwindle down to less than half, and it was in this context that they reached out to us, seeking assistance to help spread the word. I paid a surprise visit and liked what I tasted, compelling us to return later to film this episode.

The heart of the masala is the brishta, fried onions, and the spices that make their presence felt in the aromatic warmth that wafts through the palate. The meat has a bit of richness thanks to the khoa that goes into the making of the chicken biryani here, and makes for a worthy partner to the rice.\\nRs. 200 (usd 2.7) per portion; also available by the kilo\\n8.5/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nMrs. Mohammed’s mutton biryani benefits from a generous measure, as compared to the chicken biryani, of the fried onions and spices to complement the richness of the mutton on the bone, its meaty flavours fortified by some fat clinging on to the pieces. The rice glistens in its moistness and greets you with a gentle embrace, the edge of the spices tamed by the character of the meat, that also lends the rice depth of flavour. The meat is tender in parts and with a bit of a bite in others, its flavour delicate and warming, shining through the spices. If you are the sort who doesn’t like your biryani to assault your tastebuds with a spicy jhatka, this is certainly a biryani that will please your palate.\\nRs. 290 (usd 3.9) per portion; also available by the kilo\\n9/10\\n\\nRasmalai\\nRs. 30\\n8/10\\n\\nHappy Eating!\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: lunch - 1pm to 4pm; dinner - 630pm to 10pm\\nNote: Closed on Mondays; they make the mutton biryani only on weekends.

In this episode, I not only savour this special lunch but also step into their kitchen to catch the making of a steamed ‘kadubu’ and the South Canara style rasam, known as the Tilli Saaru, by Ganesh, their ‘adige bhatru’, or chief cook, who has been cooking here for over 40 years. There is something truly auspicious about eating off a banana leaf. I hope you enjoy this episode. \\n\\nSpecial Banana Leaf Lunch\\nThis is an indulgent lunch affair representative of the flavours of the Udupi-Kundapura region in most of the 20-dishes that make for a typical baale ele oota offering here. The food is served hot and fresh, and conveys a wholesomeness that is pleasing and satisfying. One begins with a traditional grape juice and mosaru vade, menasinkai bhajji, kosambari, kadubu-chutney, couple of coconut-rich vegetables before proceeding to the substantial mains of poori-saagu, anna (rice) served with tilli saaru and sambar. Servings are unlimited, and the servers are quick and efficient in dispensing refills.

Borrowing a homestyle tradition of cooking dosas on individual tawas, “he pioneered” the technique of making a dose that was both roasted and steamed. And thus began the tradition of a scrumptiously delicious, crisp and fluffy breakfast treat, now known as the Mulbagal Dosa, that has put this temple town on the map for every dose aficionado. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe. \\n\\nSpecial Masala Dosa\\nRoasted first and then steamed, the form of the Mulbagal Dosa with its upturned edges mirrors the shape of the individual cast iron pans it is cooked in. Crusty and crisp on the outset, soft and spongy within, this dose comes across as a cross between a traditional version and an appam. Oozing ghee, the dose breaks in a crisp crackle that belies its thick and fluffy body. The chilli-warming, slightly sour notes of the red onion chutney smeared within complements the palya. For a spicier bite, taste the dose with the lentil chutney.  \\nRs. 45 (usd 0.6)\\n10/10\\n\\nMasala Vada\\nCrisp and flavourful, makes for a tasty sidekick to the dosa.\\nRs. 6 (usd 0.1)\\n8/10  \\n\\nSpecial Plain Dosa\\nThe unique texture of the dose is heightened because there is none of the potato stuffing (palya) to moisten the dose; taste it before the masala dose to savour completely the texture of this unique creation.\\nRs. 40 (usd 0.5)\\n9/10\\n\\nOnion Dosa\\nMore like a thick, fluffy uthappam.

Run by second and third generation immigrants who were shipped to India by the British over a century ago, the cuisine in these restaurants had evolved to integrate Indian influences, much like how the entrepreneurs of Chinese descent, now Indian citizens, had adapted to the tastes and traditions of the land. Since then, most of these restaurants have closed doors. However during my recent visit to Mangalore, I came upon one such establishment that has stood the test of time for nearly half a century. I caught up with Louis and Rosy Wong to find out more about the Indian Chinese culinary phenomenon, and to also savour some of the dishes on offer at their restaurant, Hao Hao, Manguluru’s most popular Chinese dining spot.\\n\\nCrunchy Fried Chicken\\nA tasty duet of spicy chicken supremes encased in crisp, crunchy threads. Alongside a tangy, piquant dipping sauce, this makes for an interesting play of flavours and textures on the palate, not surprising then that this is “the most ordered dish” here.\\nRs. 220 (usd 3)\\n8/10\\n\\nHongKong Soup\\nA nourishing, delicately flavoured chicken broth that is topped with ‘clouds’ of eggs whipped into a soft meringue. There’s tiny diced of vegetables to give the chicken company with some soft noodles.\\nRs. 180 (usd 2.4)\\n9/10\\n\\nChicken, Mushrooms & Bamboo Shoots Stir Fry\\nA wholesome assemblage of veggies - chinese cabbage, peppers, beans, onions, bamboo shoots - tossed with chicken in a light soya sauce. The garlic is quite pronounced, in the flavour of the dish, and also on the bite with whole cloves that are stir-fried into the noodles. \\nRs. 220 (usd 3)\\n8/10\\n\\nHoney Spiced Chicken WIngs\\nFried chicken wings, tossed with a potent dark honey-soy-chilli-garlic sauce and sprinkled over with toasted sesame and spring onions. The chicken is crunchy and moist, only wish the sauce had seeped all the way into the wings.\\nRs. 230 (usd 3.1)\\n8/10\\n\\nRoasted & Fried Chilli Chicken\\nThe chicken is cooked twice, first roasted, allowed to rest before being tossed in a hot wok with soy, chillies, ginger, garlic, spring onions… rendering the meat the sort that pulls away from the bone effortlessly. Although spicy, the chilli heat is balanced against the umami flavours of the dish. There are also bits of chicken skin in the dish that provides a lovely flavour burst. \\nRs. 220 (usd 3)\\n10/10\\n\\nShin Min Rice\\nA one-dish meal of soy prawns, sweet garlic chicken, fried rice topped with an egg sauce that coats every grain of rice in its moist custardy texture. The chicken is slightly sweetesh with a prick of pungency from the garlic, the shrimps are a tad overwhelmed by the soy and batter.\\nRs. 220 (usd 3)\\n7.5/10\\n\\nDragon Noodles\\nMy favourite of the two main courses, this has chicken in a savoury sauce tossed with plenty of veggies, served with noodles - fried and soft, topped with an egg sauce.\\nRs. 210 (usd 2.8)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nHappy Eating!\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS:  Lunch from 11am to 3pm; Dinner from 630pm to 1030pm\\nNote: Open all days.\\nADDRESS -  Hao Hao, Basement floor Essel Wilcon, Below Radha Medical, Father Muller's Rd, Kankanady, Mangalore, Karnataka 575002; tel: +91 87928 00319/ +91 824 411 3308\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/iteU7UmSF12AR7kF6\\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nOur vision at Food Lovers TV is to be India’s most vibrant, and more  importantly, trusted food content platform.

Over the years, the fish fry, slathered in a secret masala made by the couple, and their sons thereafter, gained favour with locals who would flock to this home that carried no name. Five years ago, his son, Sathish Kotian finally put up a nameboard as a tribute to his late father’s culinary legacy that has endured decades since the eatery’s modest beginnings. In this episode, I visit Hotel Thimmappa Fish Meals to chat with Kotian and also taste some of the seafood delicacies here. Hope you enjoy this one. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\nFish Meal\\nThe fish meal is a simple affair here, there’s rice, a tasty curry made with small-sized, inexpensive fish, a vegetable for the day and some pickle. And to complete this, one picks from the selection of fish fry (charged extra) proffered by attendants who scurry between the tables and the kitchen.

Aided by the sizzling hot tawa and lashings of coconut oil, the fish has the perfect masala crust encasing its moist and meaty flesh. If you are lucky to find it on the fish fry tray, go for the biggest pomfret. \\nRs. 200 - 300 (usd 2.7 to 4) depending on size\\n10/10\\n\\nPrawn Pepper Fry\\nThe pepper intensifies the sweetness of the prawns, and the toasted flavour of curry leaf lends a savoury note to the delightful crunch of this deep-fry.\\nRs. 160 (usd 2.2) for a full portion, I tasted a sample portion of this dish.\\n9/10\\n\\nHappy Eating!\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS:  Lunch from 12pm to 4pm; Dinner from 7pm to 10pm\\nNote: Get here early, the eatery tends to get quite busy, especially on weekends.\\nADDRESS -  Hotel Thimmappa Fish Meals, Near Karavali Junction, Malpe Road, Adi-Udupi, Udupi, Karnataka 576102; tel: +91 98457 63799 \\nLOCATION TAG - https://g.page/Thimmappa-fish-hotel?share\\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

The tea shop soon began offering Malenadu style akki rotti to hungry travellers. And then meals followed, fuelled by Girija’s recipes and a wood fire, a simple affair, rice, rotti or raagi mudde, served with homely preparations of sambar, rasam, vegetable, pickle, papad, buttermilk and curd. Their following may have grown over the years, but the eatery remains as basic as it was when they first opened; I asked Balwant why he didn’t have a name board, and he modestly replied, “I thought I would put up a board when I improved the hotel,” meaning the interiors.\\n\\nHis son, Prashant interrupts to say “we are on google maps and customers find us so we don’t need a signpost anymore.” And that’s true, it’s the simple yet tasty village style food served in a rustic setting here that’s a big draw for locals and travellers alike and earned for the establishment the moniker, Akki Roti Hotel Anemahal.\\n\\nAkki Rotti\\nThe Malenadu style akki rotties are served hot and puffy with homemade butter that makes for a simple yet delicious accompaniment to the toasty crackle of the rotti. A tasty vegetable saagu, curry made of raw banana and bengal gram, helps one make a sumptuous meal of these rotties. There’s a spicy green chilli chutney completes the plate.\\nRs. 50 (usd ) \\n9/10\\n\\nMeals \\nChoose from rice or raagi mudde served with a delicious homestyle sambar and a fingerlicking rasam that’s a flavourful play of spicy, sour and sweet on the palate.

Their conviction in the dosa, and a dosa cook with credentials apparently in the kitchen of the legendary Vinayaka Mylari, Mysuru, is even stamped in the name of this culinary venture, Malgudi Mylari Mane. I venture out for breakfast one early morning to taste the dose and other meaty offerings here, and return convinced that MMM certainly offers a refreshing change-from-the-usual offering for travellers on this stretch of the road. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nMylari Dosa\\nTopped with some village butter, the Mylari Dose here served with a herb-enriched green saagu and coconut chutney. Its fluffy, porous texture also makes it a willing accomplice to be dunked in the curries. However, in comparison to the iconic Mysuru Vinayaka Mylari Dose that it seeks to emulate, it doesn’t quite manage the melt-in-the-mouth fragility of the original offering.

The butter seeps through the porous structure of the fragile idli and makes for a bite that melts the moment you place it in your mouth. The chutney delivers a potent chilli punch, the potato saagu is creamy and provides for respite from the spicy yet addictive red chutney.

Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nPaya Soup\\nThe paya is gentle and nourishing with the warming touch of pepper, an appetising start to the meal here.\\nRs. 10 (usd 0.1) for a cup of soup; Rs. 180 (usd 2.5) with two trotters\\n8/10\\n\\nFish Kebab\\nA fish fry that’s best savoured hot, the flesh is moist with the skin crispened. The masala is flavourful and thankfully does not overpower the earthy flavours of the fish, I suspect this is a kaatla or a variant thereof, although locally it is referred to as silver pomfret. \\nRs. 140 (usd 1.9)\\n7.5/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nA biryani that is mellow in flavours, subtle nuances of the aromatic spices are all that one detects in the rice, a combination of seeraga samba and the bullet variety. The meat is tender and moist, effusive in its flavour with a slightly salty edge of sheep meat. The meat combined with the rice makes for a flavourful mouthful, combine with the sherva to add a bit of a punch, the biryani is definitely a must order here if you come on one of the days they make it.\\nRs. 200 (usd 2.7)\\n9/10\\n\\nMutton Kheema Unde\\nHandground by the ladies of the house, one can discern the grainy texture of the coarse kheema on the bite and the warming notes of inger. The kheema unde is soft and flavourful, there is some egg that’s used to bring the roundels together with a bit of gram flour, but is barely discernible. Loaded with fresh pepper spice, \\nRs. 160 (usd 2.2)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nBoti Fry\\nThe boti is cleaned well and cooked with tender hithikabele (peeled hyacinth beans) which helps in toning down some of the ‘funky’ flavours of the boti. If you love your boti, you will enjoy it.\\nRs. 120 (usd 1.6)\\n7/10\\n\\nMutton Chops\\nA loaded chop, plenty of meat and some fat, that stands testament to the fact that SVS knows how to cook its meat. Absolutely delicious, the meat peels away from the bone, yet has a bit of a bite. There’s bits of fat floating in the gravy, that also adds to the rich, unctuous flavours of the curry. Savour this with some plain steamed rice.\\nRs. 160 (usd 1.6)\\n9/10\\n\\n\\nHappy Eating!\\n\\nKripal Amanna,\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nTIMINGS: Full menu is available for lunch from 12pm to 4pm only; they are open in the evenings but only serve kebabs.

       "  'description': \"#shineshetty #actor #foodtruck \\n\\npopular food truck run by kannada actor shine shetty, big boss kannada winner, inspirational story, vegetarian, mangalorean food, sabakki idli, mysore masala dosa, dose, bela kai neer dose, galli kitchen, banashankari, south bengaluru, bangalore\\n\\nDuring a particularly difficult period in his career, popular Kannada actor, Shine Shetty took up cooking to stretch his meagre resources and feed himself. Cooking in those difficult times led him to mull the idea of setting up a food truck venture for his livelihood. Rustling up a loan from well wishers, he found a second auto that he could afford. Thus began Galli Kitchen, a streetside food enterprise, a far cry from the world of glitz and glamour that Shetty was once used to. Two years on though, Galli Kitchen seems to have changed the fortunes of its owner, and has now upgraded to a full-sized food truck. I catch up with this affable actor over an inspiring chat, and also taste some of the popular fare here.\\n\\nSabakki Idli\\nAn idli that isn't too thick to hold, but weighty nonetheless owing to the sabudana or tapioca pearls. The aroma of the dill takes over the palate when placed in the mouth, the texture is a bit gummy. The idli is the sort that comes alive when combined with the chutneys, especially the spicy and sour notes of the kempu chutney. \\nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\\n8.5/10\\n9/10 for the kempu chutney\\n\\nMysore Masala Dose\\nShine Shetty’s ode to the 99-variety style of dose that would sustain him during his acting school days in Mumbai. The dose is crisp when it leaves the tava, but weighed down to a soft texture by the loaded stuffing of masala, fresh onions and tomatoes, when gathered into a tight roll. The spicy-sweet flavour of the podi is discernible above the fresh crunch of the veggies. Not a dose for the purist, but a tasty and filling one nonetheless.\\nRs. 50 (usd 0.7)\\n8/10\\n\\nNeer Dosa Bela Kai\\nThis is how Mangaloreans love to eat their neer dose for breakfast with a lip smacking accompaniment of fresh coconut, jaggery and ghee combined together with a touch of cardamom.

To earn a livelihood, they set up a small eatery in a corner of the city, with absolutely no experience but compelled by necessity and their love for cooking the food of their native land. Despite all odds, their tiny shop, Fish N Dish, prospered modestly over the years. The current situation brought all that to nought as they lost their meagre staff, most of their business, and were forced to fend for themselves to stay afloat. Alerted by our viewers of their plight, I paid an impromptu visit to find the couple cooking in the kitchen, serving customers and also cleaning up after them, assisted by their son. The delicious homestyle Mangalorean food that I tasted fuelled by Harish and Prema Shetty’s motivation to provide for their son a better life inspired this episode. Hope you enjoy this one, please support them and neighbourhood eateries like these if you can. \\n\\nLady Fish Rawa Fry\\nA delicate crust conceals the lady fish, smeared with a gentle masala that’s seasoned to perfection.

With his parent’s traditional home as backdrop, his fondness for cooking led to the creation of Thotada Mane, rustic vegetarian dining amidst a verdant garden setting, that seeks to offer not just mere sustenance but also a refreshing glimpse into an alternate way of life. In doing so, he employed an all-women team of housewives from the neighbouring villages, working alongside them in the kitchen to serve up traditional family recipes, some tweaked with playful twists to ensure there is something for everyone who arrives here.

The rotties are ‘kadak’, crisp around the edges, and loaded with flavour. The akki rotti, infused with onions, dill, green chillies, cumin and more, was my favourite. The spinach rotti is a rice rotti infused with the ‘dulling’ green notes of spinach, the raagi rotti on the other hand is quite earthy in its flavour. The uchila pudi, with its fibrous nuttiness, tart fervour of tamarind and slight sweetness of jaggery makes for a great combination with the rotties, especially when combined with the yoghurt.

The vegetables are fresh and crunchy, sourced from the nearby villages, the preparations tasty and comforting in their flavours. The Maddur vade makes for a nice, crisp touch, and the kai obbattu, served for dessert, helps round up this indulgent meal.

In the absence of present day idli steamers, village folk would steam idlis in baskets, known as ‘chiblus’ in kannada, made of bamboo, over a wood fire. And thus, these soft, aromatic chiblu idlis came into being. The painstaking effort required to steam idlis using this old-fashioned approach has caused this ancient practice to all but disappear. We travel 80 kilometres to Halaguru to savour this delicious tradition at Babu Hotel, a tiny village eatery that has been serving up the chiblu idli for over half a century now. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nChiblu Idli\\nThe chiblu idli is aromatic and steaming hot, served with a dollop of butter and alongside palya and red chilli chutney. The idli is soft, porous and carries a tart edge from the fermentation, that the butter helps balance against. The kempu chutney has a good balance of spice, and the crunch of the coconut complements the grainy bite of the hurigadale (roasted gram). The palya is savoury with the flavour of the onions.\\nRs. 10 (usd 0.1) per idli; Rs. 5 for butter\\n9/10\\n\\nTuppa Dose/ Bene Dose/ Masala Dose\\nThe dose is crisp to the touch and fried to an appealing golden brown.

Bengaluru too has its tiffin rooms and thindi houses that are destinations unto themselves and occupy pride of place in every must-eat-at list. However, unknown to many there are equally worthy eateries that have been serving neighbourhoods quietly for decades. They don’t get celebrated beyond the communities they serve and are quite content with no accolades coming their way. In this episode, I visit one such establishment, SN Refreshments, which has been a cornerstone of JP Nagar, South Bengaluru for its limited but much sought after refreshment fare for 30 years. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nHappy Eating,\\nKripal Amanna\\nGourmet On The Road,\\nFood Lovers TV\\n\\nIdli\\nThe idli is soft, porous and grainy in its texture thanks to the proportion of idli rice and urad dal in the batter, and some rice rava. When dunked into the chutney, the idli readily absorbs much of it, almost falling apart in the process. The chutney is unique, the spicy note of green chilli is accentuated by some jaggery, before submitting to the fresh crunch of the coconut, the bite of the roasted gram and the flavours of the mustard seed-curry leaf oggarane (seasoning). A tasty sambar served alongside is almost glossed over not for any fault of its doing, but because the idli-chutney combination are superstars on their own. When here, enjoy the idli, ladled over with plenty of chutney.  \\nRs. 15 per idli\\n9/10\\n10/10 (for the chutney)\\n\\nVade\\nThe texture of the vade is textbook, crisp to the touch with a lacey crunch on the exterior, yielding and porous on the inside speckled with some green chilli, coriander and curry leaves. fried onions and minimal spicing. Crunchy on its own from the first bite to the last, the vade finds its soulmate in the chutney, its airy texture submitting to the embrace of the condiment. And if  you like a vada dip, the wholesome lentil sambar is happy to acquiesce with its sweet acidity of tomatoes and a whiff of asafoetida.\\nRs. 20 per vade\\n9.5/10\\n\\nMasala Dosa \\nThe masala dose is roasted to a golden brown with brownish striations. On the palate, it is crisp with a hint of tartness, and pleasing in its flavours minus the decadence of ghee and butter. The potato palya is creamy with the rich, savoury punch of onions. The chutney, though served in a ‘ghatti’ (solid consistency), is just as impactful as its runny avatar served with the idli and vade. \\nRs. 45/-\\n8/10\\n\\nChow Chow Baath \\nThe khaara baath and kesari baath are cooked to a texture that is near ‘runny’. The veggies in the khaara baath change each day, this time around, it was the capsicum and one could taste its vegetal notes and the fried onions, alongside the toasty notes of the curry leaves and the sour twang of a drizzle of lemon. The kesari baath is pleasing and the sort that passes muster with the taste buds, making for a sweet end to a thindi experience at SN refreshments. \\nRs. 46\\n8/10\\n\\nCoffee\\nRs. 12\\n7.5/10\\n\\nADDRESS -  SN Refreshments, Phase 2, No. 11, 12th Cross Rd, 22nd Main, 2nd Phase, J.

       "  'description': \"#mangaloreancuisine #kundapurcuisine #bangalore\\n\\npopular coastal restaurant, mangalore, mangalorean, coastal karnataka, kundapur, prawn ghee roast, prawn curry, fish curry, bangude pulli munchi, mackerel, chicken curry, kori rotti, squid koliwada, drumstick koliwada, neer dosa, ragi mani, seafood \\n\\nMarried into a family of traditional restaurateurs, Prathiksha Nayak sought to create a dining experience that embodied her expression and memories of food growing up. The result is The LightHouse Restaurant, an airy space that is quite un-restaurant-like and more reminiscent of a South Canara home. Here, she serves coastal fare gleaned from family recipes and from her cooks who have worked in kitchens at legendary establishments along the West Coast. Keeping in mind her neighbourhood clientele, there’s a smattering of Chinese and North Indian on the menu too, but it is the dishes from the Kundapur-Mangalore belt that are much in favour here, as I discovered during a recent lunch here. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.\\n\\nSolkadi\\nRs. 80 (usd 1.1)\\n8/10\\n\\nDrum Stick Koliwada\\nThe robust koliwada masala finds its origins in the fishing community of Maharashtra, and although its combination with the drumstick comes as a bit of a surprise, its flavours seem to find a happy partner in this fibrous vegetable. I only wished the drum stick segments were longer, allowing one to chew on the fry better.\\nRs. 190 (usd 2.6)\\n8/10\\n\\nSquid Koliwada\\nThe squid holds on to the koliwada masala in a tight embrace, one can taste its spicy notes in every crisp bite. Definitely, a must-order here.\\nRs. 300 (usd 4.1)\\n9/10\\n\\nPrawn Ghee Roast\\nThe ghee roast masala is modified here to incorporate coconut and some cashew, so the chilli punch is toned down a wee bit, but that doesnt get in the way of an enjoyable ghee roast. One that sits lighter on the stomach as opposed to a traditional ghee roast preparation. The prawns are fresh and cooked right; this is the sort of dish that is begging to be mopped up with a neer dosa.\\nRs. 450 (usd 6.1)\\n9/10\\n\\nPrawn Hinga Udha\\nA gentle poached prawn curry, its flavours laced with the edge of hinga (asafoetida) and a lashing of coconut oil. Makes for a comforting combination with the boiled rice, the sort of preparation that you would taste in a Konkani home. \\nRs. 450 (usd 6.1)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nKori Rotti\\nThe chicken curry is robust in its flavours with a savoury onion punch, you can taste the coconut, the coriander, cumin and the slightly bitter edge of the mustard seeds in the seasoning. A delicious combination when ladled over the dry roti. \\nRs. 320 (usd 4.4)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nBangude Pullimunchi\\nYou can taste the sharp tartness of the tamarind (pulli) and the spicy punch of the munchi (chilli) in the gravy. The bangude (mackerel) is fresh, the masala though falls a bit short in steeping into the fish. An enjoyable curry nonetheless, with the appam.\\nRs. 250 (usd 3.4)\\n8/10\\n\\nRaagi Manni\\nThe raagi manni makes for a soothing and light end to a meal here.\\nRs. 60 (usd 0.8)\\n8/10\\n\\nADDRESS -  The Lighthouse Restaurant, No. 62, 80 feet road, Near MS Ramaiah Hospital, opposite to apple store Devasandra, Village, RMV 2nd Stage, Ashwath Nagar, R.M.V. 2nd Stage, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560094; tel: +91 70262 36661 \\nLOCATION TAG - https://g.page/TheLightHouseBengaluru?share\\n\\nLINKS TO VIDEOS MENTIONED:\\nGourmet On The Road, Mangalore Playlist - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLri_37vf6mmqELg4kChPIYLp4EzfLS0lq\\n\\nHOTEL FISHLAND - https://youtu.be/EW7HRFTiDcI\\n\\nCHICKEN GHEE ROAST RECIPE - https://youtu.be/IdHyaXqs6Og\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

Intrigued, I visit this eatery to taste their khaali dose, and also discover that though its name may mean ‘empty’ in Kannada, there’s much that goes into its making that has earned for Dwarka the moniker, Khaali Dose Hotel. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\nKhaali Dosa\\nThe khaali dose, served in a pair, is soft and spongy, topped with mini-dollops of butter. When eaten piping hot with a generous smear of the butter, it’s the sort that when placed in the mouth dissolves little effort.

The jolada rottis are light and fluffy, the sort that when smeared with some butter, marry well with everything on the leaf, especially the chutneys, kempu chutney, shenga chutney and guralu, with some yoghurt. The rotti wrapped with the jhunka, salad and the gravy of the eggplant preparation, is a riot of flavours and textures. The pulses, the moth bean and sprouted mung, are satisfying, the badanekayi enngayi and dhonne menasinkayi, the sort that will have you calling for second helpings.

In time, the shop added hot idlis in response to customer requests, and has since served only the idli and nothing else! The founder, Mr. M K Mahadevan passed on a few years ago, but his legacy continues with his wife, Mrs. Uma Devan and son, Krishnan Mahadevan, who till date make idlis the old-fashioned way, each batch of rice and urad dal batter fermented overnight, before being steamed and served with a spicy chutney that has won numerous fans for Iyer Idly not just in its neighbourhood but across the city. Fans who savour nearly 50,000 of these hot, fluffy idlis each month. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\nIdli Chutney \\nThe idlis are made the traditional way from idli rice and urad dal that is ground to a batter and fermented overnight. The result is an idli that is soft and grainy, slightly pasty and aromatic, with a touch of tartness. It is served with a spicy chutney that some say is more popular than the idli here.

The eatery has moved away from the gurdwara since, but the tradition of the family’s service to its customers remains, and the food continues to be rustic and wholesome, the sort you will find in a Punjabi home, fortified with loads of makhan, butter! I drove 20 kms to the far flung suburb of Nagasandra to meet Bobby, his grandmother named the dhaba after him, and in addition to savouring a big, fat meal of parathas, chole, paneer bhurji, dal makhani, palak paneer and more, also managed to down a litre of lassi! \\n\\nSweet Lassi\\nChoose from a 750ml/ 1000ml or 1500ml glass based on your appetite.

With a humble beginning, selling modaks online, Purnabramha has evolved into a full-fledged restaurant offering with multiple centres in India and overseas. I catch up with this firebrand entrepreneur at one of her restaurants in Bengaluru, watch the making of a unique maaswadi rassa, a dish from Narayangaon, before sitting down to a satisfying Maharashtrian meal that begins with an expected vada pav and sabudana vada but travels far beyond.

The spicy rasa grips you by the throat, the soft and wholesome tandala chi bhakri (rice rotti) helps tone down the spicy fervour of the rasa. The maaswadi, a vegetarian’s imaginative take on the bone and marrow concept, is an interesting play of flavours and textures - smooth, spicy chickpea paste that’s stuffed with a mixture that comprises sesame seeds, coconut, peanuts, etc. if you like it spicy, combine the bhakri with the chilli thecha and onions.

In the early days, he would procure a kilo of mutton each day, today the shop has evolved to a bustling biryani destination which procures over 500 kilos of meat on weekends to cater to the thronging crowds here. I make a 20-km trek through town to the far flung suburb of Kothanur in East Bengaluru to catch up with Venkatesh for a close look at his enterprise, and also taste the five or six dishes on offer here including his unique wood-fired biryani creation which comes across as a delicious confluence of various styles. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nMutton Curry\\nA pleasing homestyle mutton preparation that’s cooked slowly on a wood fire, the fat in the meat renders into the gravy giving the curry a lip-smacking unctuous richness.

On the nose, there’s the smokey character from the wood-fire, you can taste the depth of flavour in the rice from the spices. The meat is moist, though mellow in its flavours and benefits from being eaten with the flavourful rice, that is a mixture of two varietals, the ‘starchy’ short-grained seeraga samba and the ‘low on starch’ medium-sized-grain, bullet variety.\\nRs. 130 (usd 1.7)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani\\nSeven or eight pieces of meat in a mutton biryani at Rs. 230 makes it great in terms of value, and perhaps also lends to its mass appeal. The spicing and masala is identical to the chicken version, but the character of the mutton, with a bit of fat, imbues the biryani with a mellow, warming flavour note that’s more rounded on the palate. The meat is juicy, and has a bit of a bite.

Not due to current covid 19 compulsions, but from when they began operations six years ago. In the current scenario, they have taken matters a step further as I discovered when I visited their flagship Jayanagar restaurant recently to savour their best selling masala dose. Turns out they have stopped making dosas altogether just because the three to four-minute ensuing wait for one would have customers crowding, making it difficult to maintain social distancing owing to space issues at this outlet. “It’s a huge loss financially especially in these difficult times”, say the founders, but “we didn’t want to compromise with the wellbeing of our customers and employees!” \\nMildly disappointed with the absence of the dosa, I sought solace in their equally pleasing idli vada and chow chow baath combo, the latter featuring a comforting khaara baath made with bansi rawa.

       "  'description': \"#koshys #bangalore #popularrestaurant \\n\\npopular bangalore restaurant, bengaluru, koshys cafe, koshys bakery, jewel box, popular breakfast in bangalore, popular lunch, coffee shop, bakery, all day breakfast, mutton omelette, tomato cheese toast, fish biryani, kerala prawn fry, chilli chicken, plum cake, coffee\\n\\nMost of my visits to Bengaluru’s iconic Koshy’s, an eatery that dates back to pre-independence times, have almost always been for their all-day breakfast. Simple omelettes, comforting toasts made with wholesome bread from their bakery, old-fashioned cutlets and sandwiches, the sort that can brighten up a dull day. In this episode, filmed just before they closed doors owing to the current crisis, I partake of a couple of their breakfast must-haves, their crowd-pleasing fish biriyani and a prawn fry that pays ode to the establishment’s Keralan roots, and also take a look at how they tried their their best to keep serving customers in these trying times. I hope this landmark cafe, an indelible part of the city’s history, emerges stronger in due course. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\nDo catch our previous Koshy’s episode for an in-depth look at their history and the must-have breakfast dishes here:\\nKOSHY’S BEST BREAKFAST DISHES| Mutton Cutlet, Appam Stew, English Brekkie... Exclusive KITCHEN TOUR https://youtu.be/YCMp44D6jak\\n\\nTomato Cheese Toast\\nThis dish celebrates the sweet tartness and textures of tomato - crisp dices, sauteed near pulpy bits and thick sauce slathered over thick toast of Koshy’s homemade bread. Shavings of cheese round off the flavours with savoury notes. \\nRs. 170 (usd 2.3) \\n8/10\\n\\nMutton Omelette\\nFood doesn’t have to be complicated, but the sort where it touches your soul. Like this simple omelette, beaten egg rolled around mutton mince that seasoned sparingly, sings the flavor of the meat. Savoured with some toast and butter, this is the breakfast of Koshy’s champions!\\nRs. 240 (usd 3.2) \\n8/10\\n\\nChilli Chicken\\nKoshy’s version of this Sino-Indian staple that one will only find in India is generous in the peppers and onions, but lacking in some chilli punch one would expect. I also wish the sauce had permeated the chicken better. \\nRs. 360 (usd 4.8) \\n6/10\\n\\nFish Biriyani\\nThis fish biriyani has been on Koshy’s menu for decades and is the sort that requires one to redefine the notions of a biryani. Composed of plump steaks of kingfish, fried, cooked in a gravy and then topped with basmati rice, it isn’t one for the biryani purist, but certainly makes an impression on the palate.\\nRs. 430 (usd 5.8) \\n7/10\\n\\nKerala Prawn Fry\\nA delicious preparation of tiny fried chemmeen, prawns. One can taste the sweetness of the prawns juxtaposed against the toasty herbaceousness of the curry leaves, the singe of pepper, the lilt of coriander and other spices.\\nRs. 500 (usd 6.7) \\n9/10\\n\\nPlum Cake\\nKoshy’s plum cake has legions of fans not just in Bengaluru and the country but across the world. The fruits are macerated, rendering a slightly bitter edge against the sweetness and subtle spicing of this plum cake that is not as heady and alcohol-laced as some traditional cakes can be. It makes for the perfect sweet close to a meal here with some coffee.\\nRs. 40 (usd 0.5) \\n9/10\\n\\nKoshy’s Special Coffee\\nRs. 52 (usd 0.7) \\n8/10\\n\\nADDRESS- Koshy’s Parade Cafe, No. 39, St Marks Road, Shanthala Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560001\\nLOCATION TAG- https://goo.gl/maps/N8rjbD3qRNwwdu8x8 \\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV.

Located in almost every neighbourhood of the city, these traditional bakeries date back to the turn of the last century when two Iyengar brothers from the Ashtagrama (a cluster of eight villages) area in Hassan made their way to Bengaluru in search of livelihoods, and built on the legacy of British bakeries with their own customs and flavours. Over the years, more from the community followed in their footsteps, a trend exacerbated by the famine of the 50s which rendered agriculture in the villages unviable, leading to the rapid growth of Iyengar bakeries in Bengaluru, Mysuru and elsewhere in the South.  In this episode, I visit Sri Jayalakshmi Bakery, a 60-year old bakery that though rooted in its traditions has made space to evolve with the times. Needless to say, I also taste many of the calorie-laden but deliciously addictive goodies that have built for these time-honoured establishments a loyal fan following over the years. Hope you enjoy this one, stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nBenne (butter) Biscuit\\nThe sort of cookie that’s crumbly, fragile and almost melts in the mouth. \\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4) per 100 gm \\n8/10\\n\\nVegetable Puff\\nBite into the airy crunch of layers of pastry that traps within its folds a flavourful vegetable stuffing. A popular snack anytime of the day. \\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \\n8/10\\n\\nEgg Puff\\nOne you get past the airy crunch of the pastry layers, you taste the creamy egg bhurji that's fortified with half a boiled egg. Reason why these outsell the vegetable puff in a traditionally vegetarian establishment.\\nRs. 25 (usd 0.3) \\n9/10\\n\\nKhara Bun\\nA generous hit of curry leaf and green chilli in a spice mix stains this popular bun a yellowish green and also gives it a spicy bite. The savoury notes of toasted onions and a smidgen of sugar rounds off the flavours on the palate.\\nRs. 15 (usd 0.2) \\n9/10\\n\\nAloo Bun Congress\\nPicture a soft bun stuffed with a creamy, lightly tempered potato mash. Slice it open and slather on a generous helping of spiced peanuts. That’s the ABC for you. Soft and creamy with the toasty, spicy crunch of peanuts, delicious down to the last bite.\\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4) \\n9/10\\n\\nBun Butter Jam\\nA sweet, raisin speckled bun sandwich slathered with salted butter and Sri Jayalakshmi’s homemade mixed fruit jam, on the palate it evokes memories of a comforting bread, butter jam sandwich packed in a school snack box.\\nRs. 32 (usd 0.4) \\n8/10\\n\\nDilpasand\\nSri Jayalakshmi Bakery’s most popular sweet offering is the sort of calorie-laden indulgence that helps you get past a bad day, if you are having one.Puff pastry stuffed with freshly grated coconut, raisins, glazed cherries, tutti frutti, cashew nuts and scented with cardamom!

       "  'description': \"#nandhanapalace #andhracuisine #bangalore\\n\\nandhra cuisine, meal, andhra biryani, nellore biryani, nandhana palace, bangalore’s largest andhra restaurant chain, sholay kebab, drumstick soup, mutton bone soup, chilli chicken, chicken kshatriya, chicken amravati, nellore mutton biryani, mati kodi biryani, chicken biryani\\n\\nIn good times or bad, Bengaluru loves its biryani and the one biryani that is perhaps most favoured here is the Andhra biryani. A biryani that’s nuanced in its depth of flavour and finds its roots in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, I catch the making of this traditional biryani from start to finish at the newest outpost of Bengaluru’s largest chain of Andhra restaurants, Nandhana Palace. In doing so, I chat with second generation owner, Shweta Ravi, and learn of her family’s commitment to culinary traditions over three decades, and also savour the many creations of the kitchens here that are now synonymous with Andhra cuisine. Hope you enjoy this one. Stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\n\\nDrumstick Soup\\nMade of drumstick marrow and leaves, this is a soup that’s warming and rich in nutrients.\\nRs. 95 (usd 1.3) \\n8/10\\n\\nMutton Bone Soup\\nMutton bones simmered over hours into a spicy broth, served with a tender piece of meat that offers a juicy bite of this soup. \\nRs. 120 (usd 1.6) \\n9/10\\n\\nCarrot 65\\nThere’s little in the flavour of the reddish-orange batter-fried discs tossed in garlic, curry leaves and spices that reveals it’s made of carrots! If you are a vegetarian looking to savour the flavour of the legendary chicken 65, this Nandhana Palace invention is perhaps the closest you can get.\\nRs. 185 (usd 2.5) \\n8/10\\n\\nSholay Kebab\\nThis invention of the kitchens at Nandhana Palace is now synonymous with fried chicken Andhra style. Marinated in a yoghurt and spice masala and deep-fried, the result is a kebab that’s moist to the core and seriously addictive.\\nRs. 270 (usd 3.6) \\n9/10\\n\\nChilli Chicken\\nThe chicken is coated in a sauce of naati (local) green chillies that packs a ferocious, palate-numbing punch. If you have a high tolerance for chilli heat, do pop a few of the whole chillies floating in the dish to derive the painful yet satisfying pleasure of indulging in the Andhra chilli chicken. \\nRs. 240 (usd 3.2) \\n8/10\\n\\nChicken Kshatriya\\nThis dish is an ode to the family’s Kshatriya lineage. Stained bright yellow with turmeric, the fresh flavours of the masala hold to the chicken leg, making for a flavourful bite. A touch of cashew nut also renders a rich note to the sauce alongside the pungency of garlic. \\nRs. 270 (usd 3.6) \\n9/10\\n\\nAmravati Chicken\\nBoneless morsels of chicken cooked in a semi-gravy rich in the savoury flavours of fried onions, curry leaves and hint of fennel. \\nRs. 280 (usd 3.7) \\n8/10\\n\\nMutton Pepper Fry\\nThe meat is cooked to pink tenderness and its flavour reigns supreme beyond the pepper-rich masala. The cooks at Nandhana Palace certainly know how to treat the meat right. \\nRs. 290 (usd 3.9) \\n9/10\\n\\nBamboo Chicken\\nA tribal dish that finds its provenance in the Araku valley of Andhra Pradesh, it features chicken that’s marinated in green and red chillies, ginger, garlic and other fresh ingredients, and then poached in its juices in a sealed bamboo cross section over fire.  \\nRs. 299 (usd 4) \\n8/10\\n\\nNellore Mutton Biryani\\nLayers of flavour from the spices - cloves, cinnamon, marat moggu, bayleaf, etc., waft through your palate when you place a morsel of the basmati rice in your mouth. You can also taste the underlying sweet acidity of the pineapple, a unique ingredient of the Nellore biryani. The meat has a bit of a bite, and is flavourful. \\nRs. 290 (usd 3.9) \\n10/10\\n\\nNati Kodi Biryani\\nMade with short-grained seeraga samba rice, the nati kodi biryani takes over the palate with its spicy, green chilli laden flavours laced with the freshness of coriander and mint, and the toasty savouriness of fried onions. The rice when tasted on its own has a salty edge which complements the feisty character of the country chicken. \\nRs. 270 (usd 3.6) \\n8.5/10\\n\\nTakeaway available at all Nandhana palace outlets.

       "  'description': \"#ebony #bangalore #multicuisine\\n\\npopular bangalore restaurant, bengaluru, ebony, 13th floor, asean on the edge, popular multicuisine restaurant, popular lunch, pan indian, asian, arcot lamb chop, kakori kebab, thai crisp vegetables, nonya prawns, dal makhni, butter chicken, diwani handi\\n\\nMy first meal in Bengaluru when I moved here 25 years ago was at Ebony, a restaurant perched on the 13th floor of one of the city’s earliest highrises. Dining under the stars, I distinctly remember the food, a smattering of Parsi, Pan Indian and Continental, dished up, simply minus any pretence yet solid in its flavours, much like the character of the city I now call home. I learnt later that the restaurant came into being quite by accident, born out of a crisis after its owner, Rajesh Rajaram, having bought the property as an investment was unable to flip it owing to the adverse fall out of the first Gulf war. Over the years, Ebony has successfully weathered many crises, evolving multiple avatars, the city’s most ‘democratic’ bar and more recently, an Asian restaurant.

However, rather than buckle down, the ladies of the house aided by their menfolk are doing all that it takes to keep their traditions alive, from manning the stoves to serving customers to keeping house. I savour a delicious homestyle Iyengar meal on a recent visit, and while doing so said a silent prayer, hoping that eateries like TKS Iyengar’s survive these turbulent times.

As evident in its non-pretentious South Canara fare headlined by the wafer-crisp butter masala dose, that has won it legions of fans over the years, served under the magnificent verdant canopy of ancient banyan trees.

There’s flecks of pineapple that go into this biryani and you taste its acidity juxtaposed against the aromatic flavours of cloves, cinnamon and other warming spices that the chicken and rice are cooked in.

From sanitisation of guests, their vehicles and belongings, to meticulous back of the house and kitchen processes aimed at fostering heightened levels of hygiene, to restaurant modifications that appear to not just take care of social distancing, but also airflow management, the team here seems to have made good use of the lockdown to ready services for the new normal. Hope you enjoy this episode, folks. Stay safe and happy eating!\\n\\nBrulée Of Goat Cheese And Herbs\\nThis dainty brulée of goat cheese, crested with a passion fruit vinaigrette and basil seeds, is lusciously creamy with a smokey edge and contrasts sharply with the pickled beetroots served on the plate.

But in a format that the restaurant says is “sanitised and one that makes military-style fare convenient to families eating out.” The important question, though, does the food deliver the tasty punch that one has come to expect of military hotels that have stood the test of time? Well, I visit the restaurant and grab a takeaway of most of their dishes to find my answer. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.\\n\\nChicken Kebab\\nNot as crispy as a kebab would be when tasted at the restaurant, but the chicken is moist, juicy and flavourful. The chicken is cooked perfectly and peels off the bone. \\nRs. 150 (usd 2) \\n8/10\\n\\nCurry Leaf Chicken\\nThe rich masala exudes the toasty herbaceousness of curry leaf, however its flavours have not penetrated the meat as one would have desired. \\nRs. 200 (usd 2.6) \\n6.5/10\\n\\nChicken Pepper Fry\\nThe chicken is moist and napped in a flavourful masala rich in onions, tomatoes, coriander and curry leaf. The onions have been roasted to a deep brown. Definitely a dish to savour at Royanna.\\nRs. 150 (usd 2) \\n8.5/10\\n\\nMutton Fry\\nThe meat has a bit of a bite, after all one is eating local, military-style dishes. The buttery, unctuous flavour of the fat that straddles the meat makes for a lush mouthfeel. The spicing is gentle and warming as opposed to the fiery chilli hit one sometimes encounters when dining local style. \\nRs. 280 (usd 3.7) \\n8.5/10\\n\\nChicken Liver Fry\\nThe chicken is perfectly cooked to a creamy texture, its deep flavours complemented by the pepper laced green masala. \\nRs. 150 (usd 2) \\n9/10\\n\\nPalav\\nCooked with chicken, but served minus the meat, the khaali palav is a spicy, military hotel tradition. The palav here though is mild on the palate, if you like to pick up the flavours, combine it with the sherva, the spicy broth that’s served with the palav.\\nRs. 120 (usd 1.6) \\n7/10\\n\\nChicken Palav\\nIf you are looking for a bold, military-style pulav, this is not it. But if you’re looking for something mellow in flavour, this would be a good pulav to taste. The chicken benefits when tasted with the rice, the latter lending its spice notes. The pulav comes alive when combined with the spicy sherva.\\nRs. 160 (usd 2.1)\\n8/10\\n\\nMutton Palav\\nThe palav is deeper in its flavours helped by the character of the red meat and also the fat that’s clinging on to it. One needs to work though, to pry some meat from the bone, and also to chew on it. One of those rare occasions when I preferred the chicken palav to mutton. \\nRs. 180 (usd 2.4)\\n7/10\\n\\nADDRESS -  St Patricks Complex, unit 9, Brigade Rd, Shanthala Nagar, Bengaluru, 560025; tel +91 74836 15161\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/gS4RePt1HqfJF7uTA\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

Seated at the counter, always with a turban tied on his head, led to the eatery being popularly referred to as the Thalappakatti (thalappa - turban; katti - tied) biryani shop as opposed to its original name, Anandha Vilas, and thus was born an establishment that today owns (yes owns, not franchises) nearly 70 outposts of Dindigul Thalappakatti across the world. I visit the kitchen here to watch the cooking of their famed biryani made with small-grained seeraga samba rice, and also visit one of their eight restaurants in Bengaluru to get a takeaway bundle of their signature dishes. Hope you enjoy this episode. Happy eating and stay safe! \\n\\nKola Urundai\\nSpiced roundels of mutton mince, it’s unassuming form doesn't reveal the flavourful rush of spices it delivers on the palate. \\nRs. 137 (usd 1.8) \\n7.5/10\\n\\nMutton Chukka\\nTiny morsels of meat, soft and yielding, with a springy bite. You can taste the grainy crunch of the coconut and the pepper hit, the perfect snack to accompany an evening tipple.\\nRs. 253 (usd 3.1) \\n9/10\\n\\nPeri Peri Chicken Chops\\nThe smokey, spiciness of the peri peri masala certainly perks things up on the palate alongside a zing of acidity, perhaps from some vinegar. The mayo helps assuage the spicy assault of the peri peri chicken. \\nRs. 300 (usd 4) \\n8/10\\n\\nKuchi Mutton\\nTender goat ribs, braised in a deep-roasted masala. The meat is soft and tender, encased in a thin veil of fat which adds to the flavour. The parotta makes for a handy bread to mop up the masala, this is a dish that epitomises the way in which DT cooks its mutton! A must-have!\\nRs. 288 (usd 3.8) \\n9/10\\n\\nKodaikanal Chicken Kozhambu\\nThe chicken is moist and calming in its flavours, the spicing is mellow and cradled in creamy coconut milk. You bite into flecks of coconut as you savour this kozhambu.\\nRs. 265 (usd 3.5) \\n8/10\\n\\nVegetable Biryani\\nThe seeraga samba rice heroes the Dindigul biryani powder that makes for the masala, the vegetables, beans, carrots and cauliflower, have been roasted in the masala thus imbuing in them the flavour of the biryani.\\nRs. 210 (usd 2.8) \\n7.5/10\\n\\nChicken Biryani\\nThe rice is flavoursome and the chicken definitely benefits when savoured in its company. Taste it with the biryani gravy and its endearing tomato-acidity if you like to moisten things up on the palate. The boiled egg helps stretch the protein component on the plate.\\nRs. 240 (usd 3.2) \\n8/10\\n\\nThalappakatti Boneless Mutton Biryani\\nThis is the biryani that’s synonymous with Dindigul Thalappakatti, and therefore it is no surprise that they do it extremely well. The seeraga samba has not just trapped the flavour of the spices, but also the smoky aromas of the meat. The meat is soft, tender and moist. This is the sort of deep-flavoured, satisfying biryani that needs no accompaniment, either the gravy or the raitha. A must-order if you’re a biryani buff.\\nRs. 299 (usd 4) \\n10/10\\n\\nADDRESS\\nDindigul Thalappakatti - Marathahalli\\n88, Marathahalli - Sarjapur Outer Ring Rd, Kasavanahalli Village, Marathahalli, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560037;  Tel: 7825890022\\nLocation:   https://goo.gl/maps/NUtz7mhFXwxiEDLB6\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti – Jaya Nagar\\nNo.641, 11th Main Road, 46th Cross, 5th Block, Jayanagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560041; Tel: 7825890015\\nLocation:  https://goo.gl/maps/YMY2sCYssMaNe3Fq7\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti  - MG Road\\nBuilding, 18, Kids Camp, Mahatma Gandhi Rd, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560001; Tel: 7825890007\\nLocation: https://goo.gl/maps/cAKPkZMY6JF2T5Z69\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti  - Indira Nagar\\nPalladium, 1st Floor, No. 2021,Salapuria, 100 Feet Rd, HAL 2nd Stage, Indiranagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560008; Tel: 7825890005\\nLocation:  https://goo.gl/maps/RznsXEZqP7vxBRAQ6\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti  - HSR Layout\\nNo. 1, Second Floor, Sector 7, 14th Main Road, 17th Cross Road, HSR Layout, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560102; Tel: 7825890008\\nLocation:  https://goo.gl/maps/AQxEvtu8nWbTX91JA\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti  - Brigade Road\\nCurzon Complex, No.9, 1st floor, Unit No.1, Brigade Rd, Ashok Nagar, Bengaluru, 560001; Tel: 7825890024\\nLocation:  https://goo.gl/maps/MQNDScmC2kRdcfji8\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti  - Kalyan Nagar\\nFirst Floor, Lamcy Plaza, No.5AC, 402, HRBR Layout 2nd Block, Kalyan Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560043; Tel: 7825890026\\nLocation:  https://goo.gl/maps/fQoMg2VQgP34QHT76\\n\\nDindigul Thalappakatti  - Madiwala\\nTotal Mall, Madiwala, BTM Layout, Bengaluru\\nLocated in: Market Square; Tel: 7825890032\\nLocation:  https://goo.gl/maps/1QLut14ped2jy6gs7\\n\\nTakeaway available at all Dindigul Thalappakatti outlets.\",\n",

In this recipe episode, we cook up a seer fish curry from scratch, including a vivacious masala that lends itself well to any mild-flavoured fish like pomfret, kingfish, ladyfish, or even prawns. Its beautiful bright reddish-orange hue comes from the combination of Kashmiri & Guntur chillies I prefer to use in this traditional preparation from namma Kudla.

His son, Ganesh, seeks to keep alive his late father’s legacy in a tiny shop, aptly named Dose Manjanna, serving a smattering of traditional and some accidentally inspired creations, like the buttery, spicy Salem Idli. Concocted on a cold, rainy night, when his store had run out of hot idlis, in a bid to acquiesce to a customer’s demand for hot food just prior to the latter’s boarding a bus for Salem. \\n\\nIn this #gourmetontheroad episode, Food Lovers’ editor, Kripal Amanna tastes the Salem Idli, a scrumptious ghee onion dose and a couple of other tiffin treats that has Jayanagar’s denizens crowding this eatery at all times. Hope you enjoy this episode.\\n\\nSALEM IDLI\\nThis Idli roasted in butter, sings the flavour of the butter with the spicy, grainy crunch of the podi. Eat it piping hot, just off the tawa. When it cools down, pair it with the spicy hurigadale (fried gram) chutney.\\nRs. 20 (usd 0.3)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nButter Idli \\nThatte idli roasted on a hot tawa over melted butter, with lashings of butter and served with a dollop of butter, this is sheer decadence. The idli loses some its fervour as it begins to cool, and that’s when you taste its slight tartness.\\nRs. 20 (usd 0.3)\\n8/10\\n\\nOpen Onion Dose\\nServed folded, this crisp, kadak dose was the highlight for me. Dripping with ghee and butter, smeared with chutney podi, a generous sprinkling of moist, crunchy onions, this dose is flavourful enough to be eaten on its own. The chutneys served alongside play a distant second fiddle to this open onion dose. \\nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\\n9/10\\n\\nMysore Masale Dose\\nThe masale is smeared into a paste with chutney podi, butter and onions as the dose is roasted on the tava. I expected it to be robust in its flavours, however the potatoes seem to tone down the aggression of the chutney podi, making this a gently-spiced bite. Mix together the gram chutney, chutney podi and butter that’s served alongside, and combine with the dose to savour a spicy mouthful. \\nRs. 40 (usd 0.6)\\n8/10\\n\\nShavige Baath \\nThe shavige baath here is light, fluffy and springy, tossed in a chitranna or lemon rice masala. Studded liberally with peanuts, fried lentils, flecks of green chilli and roasted curry leaves, it makes a gentle yet persuasive impression on the palate. If you like it spicy, enjoy it with the smokey tomato-red chilli-roasted gram chutney.\\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\\n8.5\\n\\n\\nADDRESS -  Dose Manjanna, No 20, 12th Main, Near Old Sub Registrar Office, Behind Reliance Jewellery, near Cool Joint Junction, 4th T Block East, KV Layout, Jayanagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560011; tel +91 86604 72706\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/qR9ALXXmRBrGSbYe6\\n\\n\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS \\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider supporting Food Lovers TV by joining our membership community on YouTube by hitting the ‘join’ button below or on the home page.

I wish this momo was served hot though.\\nRs. 70 (usd 1) for 8 pieces\\n7/10\\n\\nFried Chicken Momos\\nThese deep-fried momos are crispy and crunchy outside and doughy inside.

The kuruma in itself is rather delicately flavoured, allowing one to savour the flavour of the meat and the lingering warmth of the spices.\\nRs. 200 (usd 2.8)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nMutton Kuruma \\nThe fat flavour in this kuruma is quite pronounced, I also found the meat a tad chewy. On a positive note, the gravy benefits from the richness of the fat on the meat. \\nRs. 180 (usd 2.5)\\n7/10\\n\\nChicken Biryani \\nThe rice is quite flavourful once you get past its slight stickiness. On the palate you taste the freshness of the mint and coriander, the acidity of the tomatoes amidst the spices.  \\nRs. 130 (usd 1.8)\\n8/10\\n\\nMutton Biryani \\nThe mutton biryani is restrained in its spice notes and spotlights the flavour of the meat. The rice is cooked perfectly in this naati, country style biryani, with the fat lending its deep savoury unctuousness.\\nRs. 200 (usd 2.8)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nKalaki \\nIn case you haven’t had enough of the meaty preparations here, the custardy goodness of the kalaki, an egg and chicken curry mix that's cooked to the point where the egg begins to coagulate, provides the perfect end to a Kongunadu meal.  \\nRs. 30 (usd 0.4)\\n7.5/10\\n\\n\\nADDRESS -  Kothanur Kitchen, Sy.

Enjoy!\\n\\nSpecial Limited Fish Thaali \\nThis thaali, complete with a fish curry, fish fry, vegetable of the day, rice, buttermilk and yoghurt had the potential to be a rather satisfying fish meal, especially given the fulsome flavours of the kaane curry. However, it was let down by the kingfish fry that although swathed in a spirited masala and crumb-fried, wasn't the epitome of freshness.

The mackerel was fresh, plump and juicy. Fried such that the masala formed a thick crust.

All that you taste is the masala, the clams barely make their presence felt. \\nRs. 160 (usd 2.2)\\n6/10\\n\\nCrab Masala \\nThe crab is delicious, plump with briny-sweet flavoured flesh. Chew on the crab shell unabashedly to lap up every ounce of its goodness that also carries the flavour of the curry. The curry too has tones of the crab ‘sweetness’.

Given the bean’s short shelf life, any unsold produce would be thrown away. Which prompted Mrs Geetha Shivakumar, owner of Sri Vasavi Vasisitha Mane Thindi to put together a food festival that would make use of the Avarebele. And thus began a unique collaboration between farmers and a food entrepreneur that now has Bangalore’s food lovers congregating here for their share of deliciousness.\\n\\nFood Lovers’ Editor visits the mela and tasted a delicious smorgasbord of preparations, from vade to bonda to dose to hollige to rotti to jalebi to payasa to pootharekulu, with one ingredient in common, the avarebele.

Kozhikode’s first lady restaurateur, she began her culinary enterprise 29 years ago as a small tea stall dispensing evening snacks. Spurred by the love she received from her customers, Zain’s today stands tall in Calicut as the address for homestyle Malabar cuisine.\\n\\nFood Lovers’ Editor, Kripal Amanna visits this cosy restaurant set in a home and meets the mother-daughter duo of Zainabi Noor and Shireen Mustafa who oversee every detail of the operation. He also looks at the making of their popular chicken biryani, ghee rice and chicken masala in their kitchen ‘manned’ only by lady cooks, before sitting down to a generous lunch.\\n\\nCHATTI PATHIRI \\nA 12-layered baked pancake interspersed with eggs, poppy seeds and raisins, each bite is a delicious crunch followed by luscious overtones of the ghee, caramelised sugar and the textural play of nuts.

       "  'description': \"#TamilBreakfast #HighwayRestaurants #GourmetOnTheRoad\\n\\nAn iconic breakfast spot in Tamil Nadu, Murugan Idli Shop that first began in Madurai, today, has scores of branches in Chennai. The restaurant’s latest outlet in Krishnagiri, has turned into the place to stop at for patrons driving from Bengaluru either towards Salem, Madurai or Chennai.\\n\\nIn this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers’ Editor, Kripal Amanna makes a quick stop at the eatery for a late breakfast, tasting some of the must-tries on the menu. This includes the restaurant’s signature Podi Idli, a paper-thin Masala Dosa, a ghee-laden Pongal, the Jigarthanda and more!\\n\\nGOURMET ON THE ROAD RATINGS\\nPLAIN IDLI\\nnot the softest idli you will come across, this one borders on being slightly firm. you taste the tart fermented edge of the batter. the idli is best enjoyed with the chutneys. the coriander chutney has a fresh flavour while the mint chutney makes for a zesty bite. my favourite accompaniment is the nourishing sambar fortified with lentils. the texture of the idli makes it perfect to be dunked in the sambar. \\nrs 20. (0.30 usd)\\n7.5/10\\n\\nGHEE PODI IDLI\\nthis idli is a lot more softer and has a certain springiness to it. Slathered with ghee and doused in a spirited, spicy podi, its texture is a lot more pleasing to the palate. the heat of the podi is tamed when eaten with the creamy lentils in the sambar. this is a delicious idli!\\nrs 32. (0.45 usd)\\n9/10\\n\\nSPECIAL SWEET PONGAL \\nthis dish is laden with ghee, so much so that it feels like you aren’t just eating the pongal but the ghee too! the dish isn’t cloying sweet, the amount of jaggery used is just right. the addition of toasted cashews gives it a nice bite and also helps cut through that dairy richness of the ghee. \\nrs 58. (0.80 usd)\\n8/10\\n\\nGHEE MASALA DOSA\\nthe dosa is crisp and translucent. you can hear it go crunch as you break into it. the potato filling is creamy, almost pate-like. a bit excessive on the salt but flavourful nonetheless. the dosa batter in no way interferes with the flavours of this soft mash. the dosa surprisingly manages to retain its crunch despite being dunked into the sambar. it's almost like biting into a puff pastry, that's how delicately crunchy this dosa is!\\nrs 108. (1.50 usd)\\n9/10\\n\\nONION UTHAPPAM\\nlove the way this uthappam is loaded with onions! the onion has been roasted to a deep brown. you taste the delicious caramelised notes of the almost burnt onion on the top layer followed by the sweet crunch of the lightly sauteed onions below it. the thick uthappam just cradles all these delicious textures and flavours! the chutney provides for a nice break, if it gets too onion-y.\\nrs 89. (1.25 usd)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nJIGARTHANDA\\nliterally translating to ‘cool the heart’ the jigarthanda is a very popular cooler on the menu here. the orange flavoured ice cream made in-house has a texture that’s somewhere in between a gelato and sorbet. the jelly has almond essence in it, you can also taste the dairy from the basundi. if you like something cooling and refreshing, settle for this drink.\\nrs 70. (1 usd)\\n7/10\\n\\nFILTER COFFEE\\nmy choice of drink after a south indian breakfast! the sweet bitterness of the filter coffee is the right way to end a slightly over indulgent breakfast here at murugan idli shop. \\nrs 32.

He also tastes must-try sides, a peppery Mutton Liver Fry, a flavourful Chilli Chicken, a wet Chicken 65 made with a yoghurt gravy and Mutton Korma.\\n\\nNAATI KOLI SAARU\\nthe gravy of this naati koli saaru certainly has some chilli kick to it. one can also taste layers of spice and the garam masala. the soft, pasty ragi mudde is perfect to be dunked into this flavourful saaru.\\nrs 200. (2.80 usd)\\n9/10\\n\\nMUTTON CHOPS\\nthe meat in this hearty curry has a good distribution of fat and the mutton still has its bite intact. the masala has a mellow lingering heat perhaps from some warm spices like cloves and cinnamon. the mutton with the gravy makes for a juicy bite.\\nrs 170 (2.40 usd)\\n9/10\\n\\nCHICKEN PEPPER\\nthis chicken is liberally spiced with pepper that gives it a delicious, toasty flavour note. you taste the juiciness of the chicken that has been cooked to perfection and the freshness of coarse ground pepper and a slight savouriness perhaps from some onion.\\nrs 140 (2 usd)\\n9/10\\n\\nCHILLI CHICKEN\\neasily one of the best ‘local-style’ chilli chicken I have tasted! the chicken just yields, and parts effortlessly from the bone. the masala made with plenty of tomatoes and green chilli is fingerlicking good! the chilli heat isn’t palate-numbing like other versions of its ilk.\\nrs 130. (1.80 usd)\\n9.5/10\\n\\nCHICKEN 65\\nthe chicken 65 here is a wet gravy of chicken kebab tossed in a thick gravy of yoghurt, curry leaves, dry red chillies and spices. the flavour of the dish is a little too tart, an interesting take on the 65, but plays a distant second fiddle to the other dishes.\\nrs 140 (2 usd)\\n7/10\\n\\nKHEEMA UNDE GRAVY\\nlove the rogan or thin veil of fat floating over this thick, lush gravy that is perfect to be ladelled over the unde or meatball. all you taste is the meat and the gentle spicing. the gravy merely straddles the unde without overpowering its nuanced flavour. the quality of meat in this dish is just brilliant!\\nrs 170 (2.40 usd)\\n9.5/10\\n\\nMUTTON LIVER PEPPER FRY\\nmutton liver can usually be tough when cooked this way but in this dish, the meaty liver is quite yielding to the bite. there's none of the gamey meatiness. you taste the roasted pepper.  to hold itself up to the meatiness of the liver, the strength of the pepper is a lot more apparent in this preparation.\\nrs 170 (2.40 usd)\\n8.5/10\\n\\nSOPPINA SAARU\\nlove the earthy flavours of this soppina saaru that is made with a bunch of different greens. you can sense the nourishment you get from every scoop of rice that's soaked in the soppina saaru!\\n8.5/10\\n\\nRASAM \\nthis almost clear rasam has an apparent tartness from some tamarind and you can definitely taste prominent notes of cumin or jeera. \\n7/10\\n\\nADDRESS - Marata Darshan, Kaverappa Layout, Vasanth Nagar, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560051; tel: 9902021970\\n\\nLOCATION TAG - https://goo.gl/maps/LzMQgsjySnPaw3Cg9\\nSUPPORT FOOD LOVERS https://www.patreon.com/foodloverstv \\n\\nOur vision at Food Lovers is to be India’s finest, and most importantly, trusted content platform in the field of food, wine & spirits and dining.

      "I often find that the most memorable meals are usually those that happen rather unexpectedly. Like this delicious lunch that we savoured at  this popular eatery in Hassan, 210 kms from Bengaluru, a couple of months ago. Guided by suggestions from our viewers, I didn't quite know what to expect when I walked into a bustling lunch session here late one afternoon on our way back from Mangalore. But the memory of the rustic, homestyle Gowda dishes that I tasted here, lingers to this day. Suffice to say I would happily make the 210 km drive to Mamatha Hotel in a heartbeat just to savour the food all over again. Hope you enjoy the episode. I take this opportunity to wish you and your family a fabulous 2021. Take care and stay safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Katla Fry\n",
      "Coated in a delicious spiced batter that complements the earth flavours of the freshwater fish, the katla fry is a popular dish here for all the right reasons. The crispened skin and the masala work well to cradle the fleshy fish.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mutton Korma\n",
      "Notwithstanding bits of fat ribboned through it, the juicy chunks of meat have a bit of a bite. And as you chew on it, you are rewarded with the robust flavours of the curry. This is the sort of delicious mutton curry you would taste in a Gowda home in the area. Makes for a great accompaniment to the ragi mudde and steamed rice.\n",

      "Mutton Biryani\n",
      "Flecks of fat abound in this biryani, that is redolent with the aroma of mint and coriander, and do well to coat the zesty, hard-spice laced rice with its unctuousness. The meat is mild in its flavour and benefits from being combined with the rice.\n",

      "7.5/10\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicken Leg Piece\n",
      "The chicken is tender and juicy, the masala has penetrated deep into the meat that is cooked through to the bone. The spicy batter that crumbs the chicken has depth of flavour that is quite endearing.\n",
