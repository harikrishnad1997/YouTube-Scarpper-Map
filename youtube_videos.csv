"From Losing Everything To Building 50 Restaurants! Lunch With SANGEETHA Chennai Founder, Mr. Suresh!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2Tprj8T1uE,"#sangeethavegrestaurant #lunch #chennai

45 years ago, a young lad found himself at a difficult crossroad.He was interested in photography and cinema, but the financial situation at home compelled him to give up his education and take up a job in a restaurant. Working 18 hours a day, life was tough, he spent many nights with no roof over his head. Things got better, when he and his family set up two restaurants in Chennai. Unfortunately, the restaurants failed and they had to begin all over again. This is hardly the kind of backstory one would expect to hear of Chennai‚Äôs iconic Sangeetha vegetarian chain of restaurants. But these are exactly the kind of challenges Mr. Suresh and his family endured to build 50 restaurants over the years. I caught up with him at their flagship Adyar restaurant, where I relished a delightful Tamil Nadu meal which in addition to highlighting the cuisine of the land is also accommodative enough to encompass flavours beyond the borders of the state. 

I hope you enjoy my last saapad from this Gourmet On The Road, Chennai tour. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A few weeks ago, I was invited to witness culinary history in Chennai. A single dining table, 156 feet long, would play host to 106 guests who would be dining on 10 courses representing 10 regional Indian cuisines presented by the top 10 chefs of the country. Curated by Chef Regi Mathew who found an equally passionate partner in 'India champion', connoisseur and entrepreneur, Mr. Hanu Reddy to support this initiative, this evening at Hanu Reddy Farms, 40 kilometres outside Chennai was nothing short of magical! This was truly a dining experience unlike any other.

Going by the number of recommendations I received to visit this place,  all roads seem to lead to Erodu Amman Mess currently when it comes to non vegetarian fare in Chennai. Although only a few years old, this restaurant seems to have built for itself a solid reputation on the back of a legacy that traces its Konganadu cuisine offerings to Erode, Tamil Nadu. I spent the greater part of an afternoon exploring the kitchens here and left only after partaking of most of their popular dishes including a delicious vegetarian meal and mutton biryani. This video is a slightly lengthy watch, but one that should have you salivating for more.

I hope you enjoy this very special episode from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

If you have a sweet tooth and find yourself in Chennai, this 108-year-old sweet shop in Zam Bazaar, Triplicane is a must visit. Especially for its dum ka roat, a delicious baked dessert of semolina, khoa and ghee that has all of Chennai flocking here. My other favourite from a quick tasting here was their ande ki mithai, a rich cake-like-texture creation that belies its core ingredient in its subtle flavour and aroma. The popularity of this Chennai institution has spawned imitators, so make sure you head to the original store in Zam Bazar, Triplicane to get your share of their iconic sweet treats.

I hope you enjoy this episode from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It is rare these days to find old world eateries that haven‚Äôt succumbed to the compromises of time, in their approach, way of life, and most importantly the flavours they present. 62-year-old Sri Venkateshwara is one such place where time seems to have stood still. Yercaud‚Äôs first restaurant has seen many dignitaries pass through its doors in its early existence, since then much has changed, but the second generation family holds on to its good old fashioned approach to serving tasty, honestly priced vegetarian fare. I stopped here on my last evening in Yercaud to relish a tasty tiffin that also included three of their must-try dosae.

Hope you enjoy the first episode from this short Yercaud food series. Stay tuned for more; take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A few months ago, I heard of this culinarian in Yercaud, Kathiravan Karthikeyan, who had spent considerable time researching the lost tribal cuisine of Yercaud, and had made an attempt to revive age-old food traditions. Cooked only in natural mediums - clay pots, coconut shells, bamboo and banana leaves, the dishes presented to me were rustic and flavourful, a delicious ode to the tribal cuisine of the land. If you find yourself in Yercaud, this is certainly a cuisine to take in.

Hope you enjoy this watch. Stay tuned for more; take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Back in 2009 when YouTube was only five years old and most didn‚Äôt know what to make of it, leave alone do with it, Mark Wiens began his food channel on the platform. 15 years later, there isn‚Äôt perhaps a YouTube food storyteller who is as popular as he is, with over 10 million subscribers. And so it was an absolute honour and privilege when he reached out to me, to introduce to him the food culture of Bengaluru. Over three days, we tasted about 50 dishes in a mega food tasting session. In the first episode of this epic collab series, we explore the street food fare of this city - egg rice, avarebele delicacies, gobi manchuri, bonda bajji and more. Hope you enjoy this watch and the others that will come up in our Bengaluru food tour with Mark Wiens.

In a move truly befitting of the time, the chefs at this food brand chose to shatter the previous Guinness record for the world‚Äôs longest dosa. And they did so convincingly, by going more than twice the distance!

The dosae is iconic and fabled here in Bengaluru, and now it stands tall, or should I say long :-), with this Guinness record - the world‚Äôs longest dosae. I was privileged to be invited to the MTR Foods factory on this momentous occasion, and in this special Gourmet On The Road episode, we bring you the excitement from the day when dosae history was made!

Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

This iconic Chennai landmark has spawned many branches, but those in the know head to the original outpost on Mount Road that began in 1951 when its founder Mr. A. M. Buhari returned to Chennai from Colombo with his eponymous restaurant post Indian independence. Back in the day, the restaurant was associated with a number of firsts, the first espresso machine, the first jukebox, and the first eatery to serve its patrons in fine, imported bone china. Today though, Buhari is perhaps most famous as the place where the chicken 65 was invented. I tasted their creation and was surprised to find it unlike any other version that passes off as a dish. Also partook of the other popular rituals here - the bun butter jam, mutton samsa with tea, mutton biryani et al.

I hope you enjoy this episode from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When I polled viewers on restaurants to cover in Chennai, Mathsya in Egmore came much recommended. Not surprising though, with a culinary legacy that spans decades to when Mr. Shama Bhat, a native Udupi set up Udupi Shri Krishna Bhavan in 1947, which eventually morphed into this popular vegetarian eatery in 1980.

I caught up with the fourth-generation, present-day custodians of this iconic Chennai institution, and in the course of doing so, also relished many of their much-ordered tiffin treats, including the rasam vada, kotte kadubu with kootu, menaskai and ghee roast dosae.

Hope you enjoy this vegetarian evening outing in Chennai. Stay tuned for more from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

I‚Äôve eaten in Kappa Chakka Kandhari, Bengaluru, and it was a great meal all right, but when I found myself in Chennai recently, I had to visit its first restaurant, which also gave me an opportunity to share a table with my dear friend, Chef Regi Mathew after 25 years. For those who don‚Äôt know him yet, this culinary doyen, a master in many cuisines, has made it his life‚Äôs work to promote regional cuisine, especially that from his homeland Kerala. The dishes that I tasted at this lunch were the sort that left an indelible impression on my palate. Made to age old home recipes, sourcing the best ingredients from God‚Äôs own country - tender jackfruit, breadfruit, chinese potatoes, pearl spot fish, mussels and more -  Chef Regi‚Äôs menu is a triumph in showcasing regional Malayalee cuisine. And has also, deservedly, earned him a recent accolade as India‚Äôs top chef.

The next time you find yourself in Chennai or Bengaluru, definitely book a table at his restaurant. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay tuned for more from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Chennai loves its biryani, and when it comes to the city‚Äôs most popular biryani kadai (shop), many point in the direction of Yaa Mohaideen, an enterprise that first came to life in a push cart nearly 30 years ago. Now with branches and restaurants across the city, old timers still prefer to visit its first outlet in Pallavaram, in the southern part of the city, where it is de rigueur to queue for and taste the biryani, whilst standing! We tasted both versions of the Yaa Mohaideen biryani, chicken and mutton, and also a couple of popular sides. 

Hope you enjoy this biryani episode. Stay tuned for more from Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

From visiting fabled decades-old culinary traditions to conversations with iconic personalities and also looking at how Chennai is attempting to push the boundaries of gastronomy. There‚Äôs plenty in this upcoming series, from streetside to fine dining, and everything in between. 

Hope you enjoy this watch. Stay tuned for Gourmet On The Road, Chennai. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A few months ago, I featured an episode with a brave lady entrepreneur who despite facing physical hardships after a serious accident had given up an IT job to pursue her passion in food. Your response to it was amazing, and soon Veena‚Äôs Kari Dosa street food stall was thriving. Until one day when she returned to her spot to find that the entire lot had been razed to the ground!  

Left with no recourse but to begin from scratch again, this time Veena opted for the safety of a shop. Pooling her savings and borrowing some more, she has set up a small Kari Dosa shop in BTM 2nd Stage, Bengaluru. However, the going has been anything but smooth with poor sales and not enough people knowing of her delicious fare. So, she reached out to us requesting support for her enterprise. I rarely ever do this, revisit a place for an episode in less than a span of six months, but I felt this delicious initiative had to be supported. I hope you enjoy the episode and will also be motivated to support Veena‚Äôs Kari Dosa stall.

Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When I asked viewers for recommendations on my recent drive back from Mangalore, a few recommended that I visit Shenoy Restaurant in Guruvayanakere. Open since 1932, this modest eatery is run by the very hospitable Shenoy family who dish out a range of vegetarian delicacies breakfast through lunch and evening snacks. The food is the sort that‚Äôs homely, wholesome making use of produce in season. On this visit, I sampled a few of their snacks including the best biscoot rotti I have ever eaten. The flavours were the sort that hit home, also compelling me to make note to return here for a more substantial meal.

This is definitely one of those hidden spots that needs to be on every travellers list when driving towards Mangalore on the Charmady route. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

If you love your non-vegetarian oota, this place is a definite must-visit when in the area.

New Shivabhag Caf√© is not just another eatery but a way of life for the denizens of Manguluru. Founded over 80 years ago by Mr. Madhav Kamath, this bustling, culinary destination is now tended to by his grandsons. A stellar reputation built on the back of some solid culinary fare that‚Äôs light on the pocket and good old fashioned hospitality is what draws loyal customers here day after day. No matter which part of the world they may live in, logging a visit here is de rigueur for most Mangaloreans when they return home. I drop in impromptu for a chat with the amiable owners and also partake of some of the dishes that are a favourite with regulars at this iconic caf√©.

I discovered Janatha Lunch Home quite by chance on this Mangalore visit, thanks to the buzz around its seafood thali that comes loaded with a smorgasbord of dishes for all of Rs. 350 only. Usually, I am quite the skeptic when it comes to offerings that are marketed on price, but having tasted this hefty plate that included anjal fry, squid uppumunchi, prawn pulimunchi, bolenjir rava fry, fish curry, marvai sukka amongst its offerings, I must say it does provide tasty seafood sustenance especially if one is on a budget. 

Check it out and let me know what you think. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

What began 20 years ago as a highway stop to provide breakfast sustenance to truckers has now morphed into a must-visit on the informed traveller‚Äôs itinerary for its comforting, earthy kappa rotti, a fluffy rice flatbread cooked on a clay pan minus sans any oil. The thing to do is to taste it with the thick curries, chicken or vegetarian, that are dished out by Ashok Anna and his family at this eatery, Hotel Laxmi Janardhana, located in a town called Yermal, about 30 kilometres from Mangalore. The setting is quite rustic, and the crowd an eclectic mixed lot. But it is the food that rules here, as I discovered during a busy morning here. 
Hope you enjoy this one. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

On a recent visit to Mangalore, I came across this egg stall that though relatively unknown is quite the hit with regulars for its punchy egg wraps, chilli and stumbler, a quintessential egg dish from Kudla. Its owner, Devdas, is rather shy and prefers to let his food do the talking. However, I learnt from regulars that while making a living as a waiter during the day, he would tend to his egg stall at night, and it is by dint of his hard work over a decade and pleasing demeanour that Devdas‚Äôs motte angadi (egg shop) is fast emerging as the spot for a late evening ‚Äòeggy‚Äô snack. Hope you enjoy this street food episode from namma Kudla.

Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

What makes Grand Hotel in Kochi a bastion of traditional Kerala delicacies is its retinue of experienced cooks led by Chef Joseph who has helmed the kitchens here for the last 30 years. When it comes to authentic preparations like the karimeen pollichathu, koonju (tiger prawns) roast, Alleppey fish curry and suchlike, the dining room here has found much favour amongst the city‚Äôs denizens for 60 years now. On this short Kerala visit, I stopped by for a delicious lunch and also caught the making of its most famous dish, the karimeen (pearl spot fish) pollichathu. If you have time for only one traditional meal when in Kochi, this place is it! 

Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

The offerings here are vegetarian, with the inclusion of eggs that seem to be a huge hit with the locals. I tasted two spicy creations, one with quail eggs and the other with chicken eggs. Needing some respite from the heat, we found our way to Mattancherry, where we tasted the thickest avocado shake at Rinoos Cool Bar.

When I walked in for breakfast and perused the menu at this 60-year-old eatery located right opposite Ernakulam‚Äôs historic Siva temple, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a connection to Udupi. A fact that was corroborated by the owner, Mrs. Meena Mohan, whose husband‚Äôs family migrated from South Canara nearly a century ago to perform religious duties in Kochi. And Gokul Ooottupra, too, seems to cater to its patrons in the same attitude of service and tradition, I discovered over my leisurely meal here. From staple classics like the vada, dosae, kadla puttu curry, yelle adda to a few inspired creations like the peri peri idli, the vegetarian fare here is the sort that draws in customers by the hundreds each day. If you find yourself in Kochi and are craving a vegetarian meal, look no further. Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Drive 30 kilometres outside Shimoga, past areca nut plantations, serene forest scapes, and the roar of the mighty Tunga river, to Mandagadde, a village known for its bird sanctuary and equally popular eateries that proffer a variety of freshwater fish delicacies. In this episode, I visit Bhavani Fish Hotel, a rustic dining spot set in a home that began the Mandagadde fish tradition 27 years ago. I met the owner, Ramesh Rao and his family to learn what makes the Mandagadde fish special, and also savour some of the delicacies on offer. When in Shimoga, definitely make the trek here; the fry and curries certainly are worth the effort.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Mrs. Geetha Shivkumar saw farmers unable to sell their stock of avarebele (hyacinth beans) 25 years ago, she co-opted them into an initiative that would make use of this delicately flavoured ingredient in a myriad of savouries, sweets and snacks. What began as a humble initiative out of her home then has today bloomed into an inspiring ‚Äòfarm to table‚Äô movement, the Shree Vasavi Condiments Avarebele Mela that has spread awareness on this humble bean and also provided much needed livelihood to many farmers in Karnataka. 

Now in its 24th year, this festival is being staged in a large venue at the National College grounds, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru from 5th to 9th January. Hope this episode inspires you to visit this one-of-a-kind culinary festival and savour the avarebele in a variety of tasty forms. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Having tasted their unbelievably tasty read to eat products, I wrangled for myself an invitation to visit the Tasty Nibbles food factory. And was amazed at their fastidious approach to hygiene that goes into the making of each of their delicious preparations. I also got a peek into the Retort technology that makes it possible for them to pack for shelf storage at room temperature without any added preservatives. Before I left the factory, I also partook of some more of their specialties, including a first tasting of their to be launched Duck Mapapas and Kuttanadan curry. If you‚Äôre looking to taste authentic flavours of Kerala, in a jiffy, anywhere in the country, do check out the Tasty Nibbles website (details below).

I hope you enjoy this factory tour and tasting episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Amazingly Tasty Yet Healthier Chaats Here In Shimoga! HARSHINI CONDIMENTS Ravindra Nagar | Must Try!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_elf-FUzPs,"#harshinicondiments #shimoga #streetfood

Raghavendra was employed in a bakery 33 years ago when he decided to set up a small business on his own. His original thought was to set up a stationery store requiring minimal capital, but given his interest in food, he began experimenting with all sorts of snacks and condiments and soon hit upon combinations of chaat. Thus was born Harshini Condiments in a tiny bylane of Ravindra Nagar in Shimoga. The fare here is chaat but in a healthier avatar. Think ingredients like fresh fenugreek, banana stem, cabbage, pomegranate, corn, et al tossed together with savoury elements of crunch and punchy homemade chutneys. Creations that are not only wholesome but also hit home in the flavour department. A must try for street food lovers when in Shimoga! Happy eating!

Nippat Masala

Menthye Soppu (fresh fenugreek) masala
10/10 

Bread Masala

The items we tasted were priced between Rs. 50  to Rs. 60, we paid Rs. 450 in all for about 6 to 7 chaats and 3 drinks.

Note: there is also another Harshini Condiments in Shimoga, apparently run by a family member of the owner, Raghavendra. But it is the Ravindra Nagar Harshini Condiments (shows up on google maps as Harshini Churumuri Corner) that seems to be highly recommended by locals.

"Breakfast At 100 Year Old SRI MEENAKSHI BHAVAN Shimoga! Best Masala Dosae, Vade, Avalakki! Must Try!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmA5ua2IUXY,"#srimeenakshibhavan #shimoga #karnataka

meenakshi bhavan, shimoga, shivamogga, 100 year old restaurant in shimoga, sri meenakshi bhavan shimoga, breakfast, south canara meal, dakshina kannada food, must visit, benne masala dosa, idli vada, paddu, avalakki mosaru, coffee, family business, shimoga food trail, karnataka food tour, gourmet on the road, kripal amanna, food lovers tv, food lovers india, truth in food

When I survey a new city for a Gourmet On The Road series, I usually invite recommendations from viewers, and post due diligence and research, these form the basis for what one eventually explores. When I called out for Shimoga, this restaurant received the most recommendations. And those in the know may not be surprised given the fact that Sri Meenakshi Bhavan has been an integral part, actually a pioneer of the city‚Äôs culinary landscape for over a century now. The space that it occupies was once the owning family‚Äôs ancestral abode and that energy also seems to permeate through the homely old-fashioned decor and the South Canara inspired fare here. The food is tasty, sumptuous and satisfying, made to traditional recipes by cooks, many who have served in the kitchens here for decades. Whilst the benne masala dosae may come as the most recommended dish, the vade, avalakki mosaru, paddu too are as rewarding as I found during a breakfast visit where I also had the opportunity to converse with the restaurant‚Äôs third generation owner, Mr Chandrashekar and his daughter, Ganavi.

If you are in Shimoga, or are making plans to visit, this is one eatery you must not miss. Hope you enjoy this breakfast episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When it comes to chaats, every city has its own style, and Shimoga is no different. Be it the masala puri, sev puri or paani puri, each one hits differently as I discovered during this outing to DVS Circle Pani Puri, a chaat shop that has held sway over the city‚Äôs penchant for its spicy fare for nearly four decades. I was told these unique flavours were a result of Shimoga‚Äôs purveyors not being influenced by chaat traditions of the North and therefore developing a unique palate of their own. Hope you enjoy this streetfood outing; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

There are only a handful of culinary institutions in this city that have stood the test of time for half a century or more. Serving their patrons faithfully, not just in their fare that harks back to the days when things were simple, but also conveying the nostalgia of many memories across generations. And so it is indeed a sad day when one of them has to close doors soon. 

I have visited New Krishna Bhavan in Malleshwaram a few times, to film and to partake of their trademark, unfussy South Canara fare. This time at the restaurant felt different though, its imminent closure palpable in the sentiments echoed by the owners, cooks and many customers for whom NKB was part of their life. 

This is an episode I wish I didn‚Äôt have to film. But here it is nonetheless. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A couple of years ago I was at an eatery in Mysuru, when a few lads walked up to me and in the course of our conversation told me that the Mysore Pak to try was in their hometown, Shimoga. I was amazed at their courage and conviction, standing in Mysuru and praising a Mysore Pak from their hometown. Nonetheless, I made note of their recommendation. And so when I recently did a tour of Shimoga, the Venkatesha Sweet House Mysore Pak was top of my list. Not only did I taste this hugely popular sweet alongside a few other treats, I also caught its making with third generation owner, Prasanna, and his sweet makers of decades. When in Shimoga, definitely visit this 60 year culinary institution.

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Over 40 years ago, Mr. Chandrashekar, originally from Sasthan in Dakshina Kannada, had to wind up his long running restaurant in Shimoga during the emergency. Forced to once again begin from scratch, he chose a spot in Birur, then a sleepy village around 240 kilometres from Bengaluru to set up an eatery. Since then Birur has grown to a bustling trading town, the spot where his venture, Preethi Canteen stands, is now a busy highway. And this tiffin restaurant has been elevated to legendary status by its many patrons for whom a halt here is a must when on the road around here. Over time, I have received many requests to taste their iconic masala dosae, and so on a recent drive to Shimoga, I stopped here and caught not just a taste of their tasty fare, but also a conversation with its second generation owner, Mr. Prakash Holla on what makes Preethi Canteen a hugely popular culinary institution.

Hope you enjoy this tiffin episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A couple of years ago when we were all stuck at home during the pandemic, I was craving for a donne biryani. That‚Äôs when I chanced upon RNR donne biryani on a delivery app. I had never heard of them before, and so Intrigued, I ordered. And was pleasantly surprised with what I tasted, so much so that I even filmed an impromptu vlog. 

Now whilst most businesses that opened during this period to cater to consumers at home were unable to make it beyond the pandemic, RNR has not only survived but scaled across multiple kitchens (at last count there were 18!) in the city and also a couple of restaurants on the back of the popularity of its donne biryani that is made to a family recipe. In this episode I visit their newest restaurant in RT Nagar, Bengaluru, where I catch up with Ramya Ravi, co-owner of the chain, who articulates that ‚Äútheir vision is to take Bengaluru‚Äôs donne biryani offering across the country!‚Äù And going by what I witnessed during the step by step making of their signature chicken donne biryani, and also what I tasted, they certainly seem to be on the right path to doing so.

I hope you enjoy this biryani making episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When it comes to tiffin eateries in Bengaluru, there are those that are celebrated, even venerated, and splashed across media, both traditional and new. Nothing wrong with that. And then there are those that quietly go about their work, serving customers for decades on end, content to not bask in the limelight. A great example of the latter is Mahalakshmi Tiffin Room in Basavanagudi, South Bengaluru, though open since 1926 is still unknown to most in the city. I visited them one afternoon to meet the second and third generation owners, and to also taste an assortment of their honestly-priced fare, including a deliciously light and fluffy khali dosae and a satisfying sambar. Hope you enjoy this tiffin episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It had been a while since I‚Äôd savoured a good military (local) style oota (meal). I had heard on and off about this 10-year-old eatery located at Devanahalli on the outskirts of Bengaluru, but never ventured out given the distance to be traversed for a meal. And boy oh boy was I pleasantly surprised when I finally did. The place may be rustic, but the food that‚Äôs dished out by Suresh Gowda and his family in the kitchen here is the sort that makes the 50-km drive here worthwhile. I savoured their biryanis, meaty fries and the curries that have earned this military hotel a strong fan following.

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A former corporate executive, Pooja Patil realized her heart was in food, more specifically the regional specialities and dishes of her family, originally from Solapur in Maharashtra, but Bengaluru residents for decades. Honing recipes, adding her touch, she opened Maskaa, a small, cosy caf√© in Koramangala, to serve comfort fare - from vada pav, thaalipeeth, sabudana vadas, misal pav, pav bhaji, omelets, paneer bhurji, even a couple of interesting chicken dishes, and in sync with the eatery‚Äôs name, a butter-laden bun that pairs deliciously with a masala tea, brewed with a secret blend of 17 spices prepared by her father.

I dropped in for a ‚Äòsnacky‚Äô lunch one afternoon to chat with this enterprising lady entrepreneur, and also taste some of her dishes. Definitely check out Maskaa when in the neighbourhood and support this unique initiative. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, safe and strong. Happy eating!

This 15 Rs. Thatte Idli Took Him From Street Cart To Own Shop In 2 Years! AKASH KUNIGAL THATTE IDLI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1O6cumZkn8,"#thatteidli #streetfood #bengaluru

Channe Gowda moved to Bengaluru from his native place, Kunigal 10 years ago to eke out a living and supplement his family‚Äôs marginal farming income. He tried his hand at many a job and trade, barely managing to make ends meet. A couple of years ago, he set up a food cart in Banashankari, South Bengaluru on the back of non vegetarian recipes gleaned from his well wishers. This too met with limited success, it was at this point that he introduced a thatte keeping in mind the clientele in the area. And that was when things changed. His soft and spongy 15 rupee thatte idli served with butter and two delicious chutneys caught the attention of locals and demand grew to an extent that he gave up the non veg menu to only focus on the idli, vade and a single rice preparation. Unable to cope with the stream of customers, Channe Gowda eventually moved operations to a house in the area, from where he continues to serve hundreds of his now famous Kunigal thatte idli each day. 
From a street cart that would barely support him, he now provides livelihood to a team of fifteen! I set out this evening to meet this hard-working gent, and in the course of doing so, not only tasted his satisfying idlis, but also stumbled upon a flavourful tomato rice that he makes to an aromatic biryani recipe.

I hope you enjoy this inspiring tiffin thindi outing. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

About a year ago, I received a request from a family that had just opened a cloud kitchen to serve dishes made to family recipes handed down through generations. Much as their fare - a smorgasbord of meaty regional Karnataka delicacies seemed interesting - we couldn‚Äôt explore it further as we rarely ever cover cloud kitchens. Emboldened by the interest from customers, the family eventually set up a small eatery to seat all of 10 in the setback of a building on New Bel Road, North Bengaluru. And this of course, provided me with just the excuse to make the trek to Kutumba Kitchen, meet the family and taste some of the dishes that have earned this small enterprise quite a few fans in a short span of time.

Hope you enjoy this one, please do your best to support deserving small businesses like this. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Recently, I was invited to inaugurate a store that, though small in the space it occupies for now, has a plan that‚Äôs grand enough to take the traditional flavours of Karnataka across Bengaluru and beyond. Out here, I tasted dishes like the haalu mennasu saaru, nuchinna unde, majjige huli, baale yele idli, gojju avalakki, and even their version of the Tirupati ladoo. An initiative of folks passionate about propagating hitherto unseen (in eateries) Karnataka delicacies, and Adukale Foods, I hope they are able to sustain and take forward their delicious vision. Do check them out at Banashankari, South Bengaluru.

It had been a while since I had filmed a biryani making episode. And so when the opportunity arose to film the complete process of a biryani whose recipe has remained constant for over a century, I lost no time to head to Taj Hotel Shivaji Nagar, an eatery that  dates back to the early 20th century, and today churns out over 500 kilos of biryani each day. I met with the third and fourth generation of the family of the late Janab Abdur Rahman, who are committed to preserving the ancient traditions that go into the making of their biryani, including cooking it over a wood fire only.

Hope you enjoy this very special biryani making episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"This Brave Lady Gave Up IT Job To Pursue Her Food Passion! Must Try KARI DOSA, Rs.10 Veg Dosa",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duBVJFs--6I,"#karidosa #streetfood #bengaluru

A few weeks ago, I heard of a lady entrepreneur who despite facing physical hardships after a serious accident had given up an IT job to pursue her passion in food. Resources were limited, so she set up a small streetside stand. Extremely hardworking, Veena‚Äôs day begins at 4 in the morning when she wakes up to prepare the dosae batter, curries, thokku and kurmas that go into her delicious kari dosa. After sending her two young children to school, she arrives at her stand in JP Nagar, South Bengaluru, where customers queue up to savour her scrumptious fare that begins as low as Rs. 10 for a delightful plain dosae with spicy peanut chutney and aromatic vegetable gravy, and Rs. 30 for an egg topped version. What lends the stall its name though are the Tamil Nadu style kari dosai, chicken and my favourite, a prawn thokku topped dosae. If you love dosae, especially the non vegetarian kind, head here. And in doing so, you will also be supporting a deserving small enterprise.

Hope you enjoy this find; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

On a recent road drive through Kolar, we made a detour to Kolar Gold Fields, once famous across the world for its gold mines. The mines have long closed, and the town is now a pale shadow of its former glory. What has endured however is a bakery that first opened in 1880 and still continues to dispense its baked wares in an old school tradition that harks back 143 years! I met its fourth generation owner and also tasted many of the scrumptious treats on offer that are still popular with the inhabitants of this verdant town 70 kilometres from Bengaluru.

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Note: I enjoyed most of the baked treats on offer. Standouts for me though were the veg puff, muffin (dilpasand), coconut biscuit, spicy cookies and plum cake.
Biscuits are priced at Rs. 30 for 100gm, the puffs and muffins at Rs. 13, and a loaf of bread, Rs. 30.

Sometime ago, I had put out a tweet asking for underrated dosae recommendations in Bengaluru. From the many suggestions I received, I picked this tiny shop in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru. What first drew me to Dose Of Davangere initially was the fact that they still roast the dosae over a wood-fired stove, a cooking tradition that is fast disappearing in cities. And their commitment to procuring unsalted village butter from Davanagere. All in all, I was rewarded with the best expression of a Davanagere dosae that I have tasted in Bengaluru thus far.

Found This Hidden Restaurant MAA DA DHABA At Bengaluru Airport! No Check-In Required To Try This!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5XCiZ0_tZ4,"#maadadhaba #bangaloreairport #northindian

I recently discovered this restaurant that although open at Bengaluru Airport City for a few months now, is largely unknown to food lovers in the city. Fronted by a veteran chef with a creditworthy reputation for North Indian cuisine, the food at Maa Da Dhaba certainly delivers. From punchy kebabs to silken dals and robustly flavoured curries and kadais, there is a popular selection of Sino Indian fare on the menu too. What also adds to its appeal is the pleasant drive to get here and its location - only a couple of minutes to the airport terminal but yet far removed from its bustle. Definitely check it out, and yes, at prices that are quite honest too.

Hope you enjoy this find; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

This was an amazing afternoon! To catch up with nearly 150 food lovers - who had come not only from all parts of Bengaluru but also beyond - and learn from them first hand their special connection with our show. I‚Äôve always known that our work connects with a wide cross section of viewers, but here for the first time, we were meeting them. Our youngest participant was just over two and the oldest, in their eighties. Truly felt blessed to meet each one of them over a delicious jolada rotti oota at one of my favourite Uttara Karnataka restaurants, the legendary 60-year-old Basaveshwar Khanavali, here in Koramangala, Bengaluru. Hope you enjoy this leisurely afternoon of conversation and catch-up over a sumptuous baale yele oota. 
Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Amongst the many culinary traditions that prevail in this state, an interesting one is that of Maratha-Karnataka fare. A cuisine that took birth a few hundred years ago when Marathas migrated to Karnataka and settled into the local culture and practices of the land. Over time, their food evolved to assimilate local produce and ingredients. Many of the ‚Äòmilitary‚Äô eateries in and around Bengaluru trace their roots to this style of cooking, although the offerings of some have morphed beyond recognition. To find examples of this unique fare that is comparatively true to its origin, one has to travel a bit out of the city. Like this 70-year-old eating house that we discovered in Malur, a town located 50 kilometres from Bengaluru. Where rustic meaty preparations are cooked with home made masalas over wood-fired stoves.

Hope you enjoy this lunch at Venkob Rao Mess. Take Care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It was wonderful to meet tennis ace, our very own Bengaluru boy, Rohan Bopanna, soon after his return from Wimbledon and being recently ranked World No. 7 for the second time in a decade. However, his constant travel on the circuit has meant that there are aspects of namma ooru that he hasn‚Äôt been able to explore yet, including Mavalli Tiffin Rooms in Lalbagh. And so we took it upon ourselves to introduce this icon to a Bengaluru tiffin legend over a leisurely, indulgent-breakfast conversation where we also caught a glimpse of his passion for coffee, and his role as the ambassador for the World Coffee Conference, to be held in India for the first time in our city in September.

Hope you enjoy this tiffin talk. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Almost everyone has heard about and many have tasted the early morning biryani at Hoskote, a pre-sunrise ritual 40 kilometers from Bengaluru. However, few visitors seem to know about a fried kabab evening tradition that is hugely popular with locals. On a drive back from Kolar a few weeks ago, we took a detour into this highway town to savour a quick meal of chicken kabab, egg rice, and a chicken biryani too. The last wasn‚Äôt on our plan, but then, we were in biryani country after all. Definitely check out Ravi Kabab Center when in the area, and be prepared to jostle with the crowd to get your share of bisi bisi (hot) kababs.

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Loved This Biryani & Mutton Phaal At 50-Year-Old NASHEMAN, Mysuru! Didn‚Äôt Expect It To Be This Good!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UR8yzsJlzlo,"#nashemanhotelmysore #nashemanbiryani #mysuru

I had heard much about this tiny eatery located in a bylane of old Mysuru, especially of its biryani that back in the day would be cooked over a wood-fired stove. And so when I received recommendations in response to a recent ‚Äúwhere should I lunch in Mysuru‚Äù post, I lost no time in making tracks to Nasheman. The place is drab, and that‚Äôs putting it mildly, a handful of tables sit cheek by jowl in a modestly-sized room, and the service is industrial at best. But it is the mutton biryani here and other meaty delicacies, especially a delicious twice cooked mutton phaal that draw customers to this 50-year-old restaurant. In this outing, I tasted most of what was on offer for lunch, after an insightful kitchen tour.

Hope you find this episode enjoyable. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Over the last few months, I had received numerous requests from our viewers to visit Hotel Aditya in Mahalaxmipuram, a eatery that in just over 12 years has managed to create for its local non vegetarian fare the sort of fan loyalty that some of Bengaluru‚Äôs revered culinary institutions have taken multiple decades to garner. The people behind the eatery are extremely low profile, preferring to let their food do the talking, and therefore reluctant to let cameras in. Which is also why you may not have seen a single in depth video or feature on the place thus far. 

We managed to get our cameras not only into the restaurant, but also deep in the kitchen where we took an in-depth look at the making of some of their iconic dishes, from the meaty curries to the terrific biryanis and fries. The best part we found at Hotel Aditya, not only is the food great, but so is the ambience that it is served in. Making it one of the very few local style non vegetarian restaurants where you can savour your meal in peace and air conditioned comfort too.

If you've been putting off tasting some great naati oota because of concerns of ambience and crowd, Hotel Aditya is certainly the place to dive into local non veg cuisine. Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Jayaramu was working in the food and beverage department of a hotel in Mysuru when he lost his job during the pandemic. Left with no recourse to earn a living, he began a sugarcane juice stall, but with a twist. Given his experience in mixing cocktails and mocktails in his previous job, he tried crushing seasonal, fresh fruits and herbs in the cane to create an interesting, healthy yet refreshingly delicious take on the humble sugarcane juice. I visited Ambaari Juice stall a few weeks ago and tasted a bevy of his offerings - malabar plum, mango, mixed fruit, pomegranate, muskmelon, et al - in sugar cane juice. Definitely something to try when you are in the palace city next.

Do support enterprising small entrepreneurs like Jayaramu who in the course of earning a livelihood are also bringing something deliciously different. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

Note: plain sugarcane juice with mint, lime, ginger is priced at Rs. 30, the fresh fruit and sugarcane juices are priced Rs. 60 upwards. My top picks were plain, jamun and mango amongst others.

A Gourmet On The Road episode that‚Äôs dearest to me is the one where I shared a meal with ‚Äònamma priyaru‚Äô, Karnataka Ratna Puneeth Rajkumar. How one wishes things had turned out differently, but alas! He wore Karnataka on his sleeve, and part of his vision was to promote young talent in Kannada cinema, a role that is now being bravely carried forward by his wife, Ashwini Puneeth Rajkumar. And when I recently received a call from her inviting me to a conversation on Aachar & Co., a film made by a near-all-women-team led by Sindhu Sreenivasa Murthy, somewhere, I felt this would be an apt continuation of my conversation with Appu Sir. 
We met over a delicious South Canara lunch at New Modern Hotel, an appropriate venue given the film‚Äôs setting in Bengaluru of the sixties. We discussed the film, which promises to be a witty family entertainer, rich in its cinematic value, food, pickles, family, a lot more‚Ä¶ and also basked in the warming memory of our dearest Appu, Puneeth Rajkumar.

I am looking forward to watching the film, you should too. Hope you enjoy this special conversation. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

My meal at Sarposh was an eye opener into the traditions of true Kashmiri cuisine that restaurateur Azmat Ali Mir seeks to showcase. In ingredients that she procures from the valley, to the brigade of wazas (cooks) from Srinagar who have made Bengaluru their home! To enjoy a meal here, park aside all notions you may have of the cuisine based on the odd so-called Kashmiri dish you may have tasted on a menu here and there. For the fare here is anything but that.
I opted for the maaz traem, a traditional celebratory meal and what followed was a procession of 12 dishes. From the initial methi maaz, soft and velvety tripe, served on a bed of rice, to a ghee-fried tabak maaz (ribs), dani phol (stewed lamb shanks) and a finely minced seekh kebab, to the hearty mains, rogan josh, the subtly flavoured sort you have never eaten before, rista (juicy meatballs), a comforting palak and razmah dal, creamy nadur (lotus stem) yakhni, marchewangan korma, the only searingly spicy dish of the lot, and gushtaba (meatballs stewed in yoghurt and dried mint), each preparation I found exquisite and subtly distinct in its flavour and taste. 
If you‚Äôre looking to try wazwan fare true to its roots, far removed from the ginger-garlic-chilli-cream infused heavy dishes that get passed off as Kashmiri elsewhere, definitely check out Sarposh restaurant and tea room in Bengaluru. 

Hope you enjoy part two of my Sarposh outing. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

The festive wazwan (maaz traem set meal) that I tasted is priced at Rs. 2300 (excl. taxes), this platter can easily feed two including the main course dishes. Since this was a non vegetarian wazwan, we ordered the vegetarian dishes separately on a la carte basis, these are priced at Rs. 325. One can also order individually the non vegetarian dishes that we tasted, chicken dishes begin at Rs. 425, mutton at Rs. 600.

When Azmat Ali Mir moved from Srinagar to Bengaluru after marriage, she yearned for authentic Kashmiri food, but ‚Äúthere was none to be found‚Äù, she says. A casual idea of staging a Kashmiri pop-up for a few friends ‚Äòavalanched‚Äô into a dinner for 1000 guests, compelling her to fly in wazas (Kashmiri cooks) to prepare the meal. Encouraged by the response, and her husband Azeem Syed, she embarked on setting up a space that sought to not only celebrate true Kashmiri cuisine, but also its culture and traditions. Thus was born Sarposh restaurant and tea room in Indiranagar, Bengaluru. Needless to say, the cooks (wazas) stayed back. I visited her for lunch one afternoon and was blown away by the sheer depth of cuisine and culture that this young entrepreneur seeks to showcase in her cozy dining space, which also offers a fascinating insight into the traditions of her land in its decor and artifacts. What was intended as a typical review lunch turned into an engrossing conversation with Azmat and her team, thereby resulting in this rare two-part Gourmet On The Road episode. Hope you enjoy part one.

Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It had been a while since I visited South Canara, and so when a craving for a good Mangalorean meal hit me, I found my way to this tiny eatery that‚Äôs almost hidden in a bylane of Malleshwaram. Run by Ravi Shetty, an affable native of Kundapura who has been cooking since the age of 17, Karavali Lunch Home offers a delicious smorgasbord of coastal flavours from Dakshina Kannada featuring unique dishes like the country chicken uppu koli, that has earned it loyal patrons in its 15 years of existence. What also finds favour here is the freshness of the seafood that Ravi procures each day. and also their pocket friendly fish thaalis that are priced upwards of Rs. 140.

If you are craving authentic flavours of kudla, check them out. Hope you enjoy this episode.  Take care. Stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Sumathi was content being a homemaker, when her husband Charles, a software engineer, encouraged her to open a small eatery given her passion for cooking. She began one and ran it for a few months, when tragedy struck, and her husband was no more. Left with no recourse to fend for her three children and herself, Sumathi Charles ploughed her entire savings into setting up a modest eatery serving Tamil Nadu style vegetarian tiffin and meals. I visit The Madhras Kitchen early one evening and leave thoroughly impressed with most of the dishes I taste. I have no doubt that if this eatery remains true to its cuisine philosophy, it will certainly emerge as a must-eat-at place on Bengaluru‚Äôs culinary trail. Located in the heart of Bengaluru on Castle Street, this clean, hygienic eatery is certainly worthy of more than one visit. Do taste their delicious fare, and in doing so, support yet another deserving small business.

Take care. Stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

The pandemic was a difficult time for Mahi and her husband Majeed. Their little son fell seriously ill and to nurse him back to health, this young couple had to borrow a fair bit of money. However soon thereafter Mahi lost her job. Left with no recourse, she turned to her love for cooking and opened a small shop near her home in Akshayanagar, a distant suburb in South Bengaluru, where she serves Lucknowi biryani and kebabs made to her grandmother‚Äôs recipe at home. There‚Äôs only a table to seat four and a few regulars in the area who order takeaways. But business has been tough, and the young couple have been having a tough time trying to make ends meet and repay their loans. I received an appeal from Mahi, and after making discreet enquiries, visited them for a meal. While the tiny size of the shop, it‚Äôs no more than a kiosk, with a table outside to seat four, did surprise me, what floored me completely was the taste of the fare that is served out of Biryani Delicacy. I will definitely return for the biryani and the kebabs. And needless to say, you should visit too. To savour a unique Lucknow style biryani that has been tweaked a bit to suit Bengaluru‚Äôs palate, and to also support a deserving small enterprise.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Tackle care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ganesh may not speak or hear, but he certainly knows the pulse of his customers when it comes to preparing and serving them fresh teas, each one brimming with the goodness of natural ingredients. I am told he began this enterprise when he lost his father owing to some ailment that couldn‚Äôt be cured. Ganesh took it upon himself to research and prepare a variety of teas that he believed could help his customers stay healthy and restore them from day to day health niggles. It was inspiring to watch this one-man-army go about his work serving the community when I dropped in unannounced at his small store one evening.

Please do support this small business and share this video to encourage differently abled entrepreneurs like Ganesh who notwithstanding their challenges  are bravely standing on their own, and are in many ways an inspiration to society.

Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!


Note: Each tea dispensed by Ganesh is unique. Whilst some of them may taste a bit medicinal, they are extremely beneficial to one‚Äôs health, say regulars. My favourites were green tea, lemon tea and jaggery tea. Teas are priced upwards of Rs. 20.

A couple of years ago, I visited a fledgling highway eatery that was trying to find its feet in the aftermath of the lockdown. I enjoyed my meal there and our ensuing video prompted many of you to visit Malgudi Mylari Mane, Nelamangala. Things have improved for them to such an extent that they have recently opened their second restaurant, right here in Bengaluru. I had to check it out, and find out happily so, that the food still retains its delicious, rustic appeal, and is a wonderful complement to an age-old Mysore inspired dosae. Wonderful to see small businesses succeed. Check them out.

When Dr Gani Ganeshwar was studying medicine in Mangalore, he fell in love with the port city‚Äôs iconic Ideal Ice Creams and Pabba‚Äôs. Over the years of studying medicine, he consumed many of their creations and pondered over the possibility of bringing these to Bengaluru. Nearly a year ago, the thought finally came to fruition when this enterprising doctor began Scoops of Mangalore, where Ideal ice creams are not only sold in retail packs, but also fashioned into the most popular Mangalore Gadbad‚Äôs, Tiramisu‚Äôs, Parfaits and the like. I dropped by one evening to check if these ice cream concoctions hit the spot like they would in Kudla (Mangalore)!

Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ranganatha was only in the fifth grade when he began assisting his brother-in-law at his chat cart after school. Soon, his interest in making chaat overtook any academic inclinations and after completing seventh grade, he gave up school. Soon, his family joined in too, his father giving up his profession as an automotive mechanic, his mother, and much later, his wife, assisting in preparing the masalas, chutneys, etc. at home. Over the last two decades or so, the cart has made way to a tiny shop and Sri Ranganatha Chats Corner has emerged as a favourite chaat spot in the neighbourhood, not only for their homestyle, simple preparations, but also the friendliness with which they interact with customers, many who have been tasting their fare over years.

Meet them when you‚Äôre in Malleshwaram next, and do your best to support small neighbourhood enterprises like these. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When travellers alight at Chikmagalur bus stand, they cross the road and head to this eatery that has a reputation for serving simple, unfussy, old fashioned vegetarian fare for over three decades now. In the transformation that has swept through most of this coffee town, one is thankful for places like Soundarya Hotel that stands resolutely holding on its old fashioned decor and values, serving tasty tiffin, meals and coffee at extremely affordable prices, endearing it to both travellers (in the know) and locals alike. On my last morning in Chikmagalur, I stopped here for a quick breakfast and made a mental note to return for more.

Hope you enjoy this one too. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Narasimha Murthy‚Äôs livelihood as a masala salesman was disrupted owing to covid, he set up a tiny eatery serving seafood. Thrice, but each one failed. As a last resort, he approached Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation, and they suggested he explore the model of a seafood mobile canteen that he set up a couple of years ago. Murthy still keeps his day job, selling spice mix packets throughout Bengaluru whilst his wife, Sunanda cleans the fish and prepares the masala throughout the day. And in the evening, they drive their seafood fry truck to Rajajinagar, where this hard working couple cook, and serve the neighbourhood. The fish that they serve is fresh, sourced from KFDC each day, and their fries, delicious as I discovered when I paid them an impromptu visit a few weeks ago.

I salute their work ethic, and hope many of you will be inspired to support this small enterprise. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Each time I passed this popular eatery in Rajajinagar, West Bengaluru, I would see scores of customers standing on the footpath, oblivious to the cacophony of the traffic all around, immersed in relishing a glass of what looked like a mango shake. And so when an opportunity presented itself on a recent shoot outing, I stopped by at Hotel Sagar to check out for myself what their special mango milkshake served year round (which I think also adds to its appeal) was all about! 

Hope you enjoy this short watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ask most locals in Chikmagalur where they go for their dosae fix, and chances are they will mention this eatery, also one of coffee town‚Äôs earliest. Over the last 63 years, Town Canteen, that sits on the edge of IG Road, has emerged as the place to go for the scrumptiously crisp, buttery, benne masala dosae, chased de rigueur with soft, cardamom sugar syrup soaked gulab jamuns, and their special blend filter coffee. Although I tasted these two years ago, I couldn‚Äôt miss an encore when we were filming a Gourmet On The Road series in coffee town a few weeks ago.

A definite must-try when in Chikkamagaluru. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

I first discovered The Vintage in Chikmagalur a couple of years ago when Sree and I, having emerged from the pandemic, were looking to take a break in a safe environment. This villa homestay set in an orchard came recommended. Since then, we have returned twice again to the endearing hospitality of its owner, Charles Baptist, who personally leaves no stone unturned to ensure his guests enjoy a refreshing Chikmaglur experience. On this visit to film a Gourmet On The Road series in coffee town, we camped here and left only after partaking a delicious Malenadu brunch, highlights of which included a tender jackfruit curry, tasty Malnad chicken, kadak fish fry and a surprising bottle gourd payasa. Definitely a spot to consider when you‚Äôre planning your next weekend break.

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

I first came across this 85-year-old coffee institution when I visited Chikmagalur over two years ago. Since then, their Grand Aroma blend has been a staple in our coffee shelf at home. On this visit though, I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only is this heritage coffee roasting and blending house holding on to its traditional blends, but has since made notable strides in creating an assortment of coffee varieties to suit every palate. If you‚Äôre visiting Chikkamagaluru, a visit to this old-school coffee retail shop is a must. And when there, do chat up with the Setty brothers and request to take a peek at the making of some of their blends.

Hope you enjoy this coffee episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A chance conversation with students at his eatery, Nisarga Grand in Bengaluru, five years ago led Krishnaraja SP to offer free dosae to them if they exercised their civic duty and voted! Since then, this humble restaurateur has offered free dosae to anyone who walks into his restaurant on election day and shows their inked finger. I stepped into his eatery too, having exercised my franchise, to avail of a free benne khali dosae, mysore pak and juice this year. In doing so, I learnt of the challenges he faced this year, and also the fact he was foregoing most of his normal business on election day to cater to voters, over 5,000 of them!

Hope you enjoyed this episode that promotes a social cause. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Vani, a dietician, and her husband, Harsha, a IT professional, chanced upon an ice cream churner at an exhibition in Bengaluru, they saw in it an opportunity bring to fruition their plans of creating 100% natural ice creams, made only with fresh fruits and nuts, sans any artificial flavours, colours or additives. A trip to Italy to learn the art of making gelato, low fat ice creams, followed by months of honing recipes at home, led to the birth of their ice cream parlour, Churn in a leafy bylane of RMV 2nd Stage. The ice creams here are made fresh everyday using only seasonal ingredients. Although Churn has its share of loyal patrons in and around the neighbourhood, their ice creams are perhaps unknown to most of Bengaluru. I visit Churn to meet the friendly couple, learn the art of making gelato and taste every flavour that‚Äôs in the store. 

Hope you enjoy this episode. Support small businesses. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

This was an unexpected find. I was told by my friend, Charles Baptist that the denizens of Chikmagalur too have warmed up to the donne biryani phenomenon, and one of the most favoured  stops for coffee town‚Äôs unique take on this popular biryani tradition is MG Road Donne Biryani. The biryani here is spicy, stained a yellowish-red, unlike the greenish-yellow donne biryanis one finds in Bengaluru, and certainly packs a tasty punch. Hope you enjoy this biryani outing in Chikkamagaluru!

Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When I visited Chikmagalur a few months ago, I dropped into Tasty World Food Factory unannounced, and was taken in by the concept of the place that has provided for visitors an air-conditioned viewing gallery to look into the hygienic production of traditional Karnataka snacks and namkeen here. Needless to say, I had to return with my crew to film a Gourmet On The Road episode. I hope you enjoy this walk though what will soon be on every must-visit list in this coffee town, and my tasting of some of their interesting, homely tiffin preparations.

Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ultimate Chikmagalur Coffee Tasting Experience! WORLD OF COFFEE | Brew Filter Kaapi To Civet Coffee!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfQ_UmdI2_c,"#worldofcoffee #coffeeexperience #chikkamagaluru

It is said that coffee first found its way into India through a Sufi saint, Baba Budan who, having smuggled seven coffee beans from Arabia in his beard, planted these in the hills around Chikkamagaluru in the late 17th century. Fitting therefore that this coffee town is also home to a unique coffee store that offers customers an immersive walk through the history, brewing and experiential tasting of coffee. I visited World Of Coffee on a recent trip and tasted a host of coffee - new age artisan varieties like pineapple fermented, honey infused, foraged civet coffees, and traditional filter coffee. When in Chikmagalur, you must explore coffee and this store is a great place to start.

Hope you enjoy this heady brew of an episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Tasting:
Each of the coffees tasted left a mark. My favourites though, in descending order of preference - civet coffee, filter coffee, cold brew, fruit and honey infused coffee. And to taste coffee in a dessert form, the panna cotta is highly recommended.

The coffee panna cotta is priced at Rs. 170, and the artisan coffees around Rs. 170.

This isn‚Äôt a typical Gourmet On The Road episode. What appealed to me most about Director, Santhosh Ananddram‚Äôs upcoming film, Raghavendra Stores, set in a fictional eatery in Malenadu, wasn‚Äôt just its earthy, realistic portrayal of culinary traditions, but also its message. That tackled headlong the social challenges faced by those in the food trade, the protagonist in this film unable to find a bride due to his profession as a cook or ‚Äòadige bhatta‚Äô. In this fun conversation, I catch up with Santhosh Ananddram, and actors, Navarasa Nayaka Jaggesh and Shwetha Srivatsav over a delicious tiffin thindi at a Malleswaram icon, Sri Raghavendra Stores.

Am definitely looking forward to watching the full film, if you‚Äôre a food lover, you must too. Hope you enjoyed this special episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Rediscovered 41-Year-Old HOTEL PARIMALA, Kunigal! Good Old Fashioned Food At Honest Prices!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ2qgxRKhAY,"#hotelparimala #kunigal #hassanhighway

Long before the current Mangalore highway was built, travellers from Bengaluru enroute to Hassan, Coastal Karnataka and beyond took the state highway that would meander through towns along the way. Kunigal was an important stop back then, and I remember pit stops for breakfast here in the nineties when quality eateries were hard to find, barring places like Hotel Parimala that first opened doors over four decades ago. Since then, a new highway has emerged that bypasses most such places. On a recent road trip to Chikmagalur though, I decided to stop at Hotel Parimala and rediscovered for myself a culinary institution that takes great pride in its age-old traditions that places great emphasis on serving quality fare to customers at prices that also seem to be an honest echo to the past.

I hope you enjoy this episode enough to revisit old eateries like Hotel Parimala that have been bypassed by modern highways. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It had been a while since I savoured the street food delicacies of Mosque Road, Frazer Town, Bengaluru, especially the sort that are showcased around Ramzan. And so with my friend, Chef Fasiulla to guide me, we set about tasting the fare on offer this year. A combination of classics from age old eateries, and some surprising new twists with influences that draw from beyond Bengaluru. Whilst the street food vibe with the stalls and the buzz of food lovers during Ramzan is quite unique, what‚Äôs heartening is that many of the must-try dishes are now offered through the year.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Tasty, Old Fashioned South Canara Veg Lunch At UDUPI SRI KRISHNA BHAVAN, Bengaluru | 100 Years Old!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNHRAsc5rZ8,"#udupisrikrishnabhavan #lunch #bangalore

My last visit to Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan in Balepete for an early tiffin coincided with the conclusion of their lunch service. I watched some of the lunch crowd relishing their thali meals, and made a note to return for the same someday. And so when on a recent visit to Chickpete, a lunch opportunity suddenly opened up, I lost no time in heading to this near-100-year-old eatery to taste their South Canara lunch. It‚Äôs a simple affair - couple of vegetable preparations, lentils, rasam, poori and rice, even a sweet - quite homely in its taste and sumptuous enough to fill one‚Äôs belly for a very affordable Rs. 110 only. And consumed in the restaurant‚Äôs heritage setting, it is also the sort of meal that transports one back to ‚Äògood ole yesteryear‚Äô! Definitely plan a lunch here when in the area.  

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A farmer by profession, Mr. Rangaswamy opened a small thatched eatery on his property abutting the highway in Gowdagere, near Channarayapatna, 15 years ago to serve tea and snacks to travellers on the Bengaluru Hassan route. As the eatery became popular, his family also introduced their unique village style biryani along with other meaty preparations like the mutton sambar, thale kaalu and chops. He has since passed on, but his family continues his culinary traditions at SLR Biryani. Notwithstanding the recent construction of a flyover that bypasses this humble home eatery and has impacted business here, it still manages to hold on to its loyal patrons. The popularity of their wood-fire-cooked biryani is such that it runs out in a few hours each morning, after which it is the mutton dishes served with ragi mudde, plain rice or khushka that occupy centrestage. I dropped in impromptu for lunch one afternoon and was elated to find, through a tremendous stroke of luck, the biryani that was prepared for a special order.

Hope you enjoy this rustic episode. Please do support deserving, small enterprises like this. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Mr. Srinivas Padiyar, a native of Kundapura, set up a sugarcane juice shop in Seshadripuram in 1977. However, fed up with the flies that would swarm around sugar cane, he shifted to making fruit juices, his attempt being to offer fruit juices with no sugar to the extent possible, by juicing only the freshest produce in the prime of their season. This coupled with his honest approach, ‚Äúto offer customers full value for their hard earned money‚Äô has earned for Lakshmi Juice Centre a loyal following through the years. I visited the store one warm evening to taste some of his most popular offerings.

Hope you enjoy this refreshing episode. Take care, stay safe and strong.

When Mr. and Mrs. M. Mahadev Rao moved to Peenya on the outskirts of Bengaluru, this area was a remote industrial outpost where a few factories lay scattered amongst fields. With a family of seven children to feed and educate, this couple rented a shed to run a small tiffin shop that fueled workers and staff in the manufacturing units around. Over time, the popularity of their homely vegetarian tiffin fare and meals grew, also earning for the humble eatery the moniker ‚ÄòBhatru Hotel‚Äô, as the couple were constantly cooking and feeding customers. 34 years on Gurukrupa Bhats Canteen stands strong as a cornerstone in this now bustling suburb, a daily ritual for many of its patrons, for whom a day is incomplete without coffee, tiffin or a meal here. Now in his nineties, Mr Rao has left the running of the eatery to his sons who are involved in every aspect of the operation - from the cooking to the serving and speaking a kind word or two with their customers, many who share decades-old relationships with the place. I dropped in for a quick tiffin, but felt compelled to linger on and savour many of the dishes on offer.

I must admit I sampled far more than I finally ordered here, but this was a fun tasting of some of Kolkata‚Äôs legendary Pabrai‚Äôs Ice Creams - Gandharaj lemon, Kolkata sweet paan, custard apple and more. My pick though was the Nolen Gur, an ingenious ice cream creation bearing the sticky, caramel notes of the date palm jaggery, some of it also imbued in the rich, creamy smooth texture of the ice cream. Certainly a flavour that must be tried here.

Shyam Mishra moved from Allahabad to Bengaluru 35 years ago to set up a small juice shop in a narrow alley of Chickpet. That in itself wasn‚Äôt an event perhaps, but it was his recipes for fresh juice blends and rich creamy milk shakes created only with seasonal produce that over time has made Shyam Mishra Juice Centre a destination not only in the area but am told also in the dozen or so outlets it operates in Bengaluru, manned by the extended family that has since migrated to the city to support the trade. I dropped in at their original store to taste nine of their popular offerings, each one special and refreshing. Definitely a juice shop to add to your summer cooler list. 

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!.

When Amudha‚Äôs husband, Manikanta lost his small trade owing to the pandemic, she decided to convert her tiny cook-at-home enterprise into something that would enable the family to earn a livelihood. She came up with the idea of a street side vegetarian barbecue shop as a concept that was healthy and would perhaps also resonate with customers. However, not one to take the easy way out, she took assistance to learn barbecue recipes and practices from a five star chef before launching Sri Sai Veg Bbq in Banashankari, South Bengaluru. Over the last two years, this family has won the hearts of food lovers in the neighbourhood for their delicious warming fare that is prepared with a whole lotta love, care and packs a tasty punch.

Please do your best to support deserving small enterprises like this that are doing tasty work in your neighbourhood. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Prabhakar Hegde moved from his native Sirsi in Uttara Kannada to Bengaluru in the nineties to earn a livelihood. He found employment at the iconic Veena Stores in Malleshwaram, and after a few years of working there decided that cooking and serving tiffin was his calling. He went on to open a tiny store in Vidyaranyapura, a far flung locality in North Bengaluru, 23 years ago, a place so remote that back then only a handful of buses would ply there each day. However today, the area has grown into a bustling suburb, and so has Hegde‚Äôs Fast Food which is now a cornerstone of the neighbourhood for its idli, vade and a couple of other thindi items. Having received a bunch of recommendations in support of this shop, I visited Hegde impromptu for a chat one evening with him, and also with the locals who have monikered this place as the Veena Stores of Vidyaranyapura.

Please do your best to support tiny small businesses like these that need all the help that they can get for the delicious work they do. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Mr Mohan Rao couldn‚Äôt find a job in Bengaluru after completing his engineering degree, he hired a cook from Nellore and began a restaurant in 1981. Over time Hotel Navayuga became popular amongst its patrons for the biryanis, kebabs and fries. Its patrons include not just with the common man and hordes of travelers given its location in Gandhinagar, but its fare has also endeared itself to luminaries of Karnataka, most noteworthy being the Dr Rajkumar parivar. 

I was told about this place by Karnataka Ratna, Dr. Puneeth Rajkumar, Appu Sir, and more recently shared a meal with his nephew, Vinay Rajkumar and Anushree when I tasted some of Dr Puneeth Rajkumar‚Äôs most favourite dishes here. In this Gourmet On The Road episode, I return to taste some of the delicacies that have transformed Hotel Navayuga from an eatery that was born out of the need for a livelihood to a Bengaluru culinary icon.

I hope you enjoy this very special episode, also catch part one where I visit the kitchens of Navayuga to explore what makes their iconic biryani special, in addition to watching the making of the other favourites here like the chicken kebab, fish fry and more.

I was first introduced to Hotel Navayuga during the course of my most memorable meal, with Karnataka Ratna, Dr Puneeth Rajkumar, Appu Sir. We were relishing a traditional jolada rotti oota, but somewhere our conversation veered to tasting a biryani during our next meal. Alas, that wasn‚Äôt meant to be, but deep down I feel that if it would have been at Hotel Navayuga, a 40-year-old eatery that Appu Sir spoke about quite fondly. I did make a visit to the eatery later, to record a tribute episode to commemorate his last film over a meal with his nephew, Vinay Rajkumar and Anchor Anushree. It was also during the course of this meal that I decided I must return to film a full-fledged Gourmet On Episode.

I hope you enjoy part one of this episode, where I visit the kitchens of Navayuga to explore what makes their iconic biryani special, in addition to watching the making of their other favourites like the chicken kebab, fish fry and more.

"Softest, Fluffiest SRI LAKSHMI BHAVAN TIFFIN ROOM Khaali Dosae Making & Tasting! 68 Year Recipe!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4q32BY2jRA,"#lakshmibhavantiffinroom #chitradurga #khaalidosa

Over the last couple of years, I have received innumerable requests from our viewers to taste the khaali dosae at Chitradurga‚Äôs popular Sri Lakshmi Bhavan Tiffin Room. And so, on a recent drive through the area, I stopped at this 68-year old institution where I enjoyed my short conversation with the humble second-generation proprietor, Mr Mahabala, and also caught the making of what is perhaps one of the fluffiest khaali dosae that I‚Äôve eaten. Khaali means ‚Äòempty‚Äô in kannada, there is no oil deployed in the dosae‚Äôs cooking, but ironically the tradition here is to serve it with some tuppa (ghee), and palya (potato stuffing) to make for an enjoyable, filling thindi. And they say, you shouldn't leave here without tasting their soft gulab jamun, which is what i savoured too in addition to a lovely idli sambar.

Hope you enjoy this tiffin watch, definitely pencil the place into your travel plans when in and around Chitradurga. Happy eating.

"Must Try Homely Non Veg Meals At CHAAPE REDDY HOTEL Chitradurga! Best Mutton, Rustic Highway Eatery",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyjfHcFfd_E,"#chaapereddyhotel #chitradurga #highwayeatery

Not enjoying his vocation as a public works contractor, Satyanarayana Reddy converted a part of his home into a rustic eatery in Chitradurga, seeking to serve non vegetarian delicacies made to his wife‚Äôs recipes. The eatery had no signboard for many years, but gained immense popularity amongst locals for its unique mutton and chicken dishes. However, it is still largely undiscovered to most travellers which is ironic given its location just off the highway. The atmosphere of this 31-year-old eatery is rather rudimentary, but the fare served here is the sort that will have you reminiscing its robust flavours well into your journey.

Hope you enjoy this delicious find; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

The pandemic was tough on the hospitality industry and the people who worked in it, many who found themselves out of employment. My good friend, Chef Amit Wadhawan however saw in this adversity an opportunity to convert an interest, that of bottling traditional and modern expressions of flavours in a hand crafted range of jams, chutneys, pickles and preserves, into a small business. Sold under the name, Supernatural Society, these delicious offerings are cooked by him personally in small batches sans any preservative, low sugar and with perhaps the highest concentration of fruits and other natural ingredients. I caught up with Amit in Delhi over a delightful tasting of some of his jars.

Hope you enjoy this watch. Please do your best to support small businesses like this. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

"This 36-Year-Old RAJKUMAR HOTEL Serves A Great Village Style Thatte Idli! Avarebele Usli, Khali Dosa",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJHs4hMbUWY,"#rajkumarhotel #thatteidli #tumkur

Brothers Basavaraju and Shivakumar are huge fans of Dr Rajkumar and family. So much so that their 36-year-old eatery has no name board, but is simply known to locals as Rajkumar Idli hotel in Tumkur. In my tasting of their old-fashioned thatte idli, a harkback to the 'acrey' idli of yore, when idlis where steamed on large plates prior to the advent of modern idli steamers, I discover that their devotion to Kannada cinema‚Äôs most iconic family is also mirrored in their pursuit to preserving an age old idli tradition. This unpretentious shop is definitely worth a stop when on the route.

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Sisters Chandrakala and Shoba were running a successful catering business which was unfortunately brought down by the pandemic. They lay low for 27 months before bouncing back with a small eatery to serve up Andhra delicacies made to the recipes of their parents and grandparents. Curryce Andhra Bhojanam, located in RT Nagar, North Bengaluru is only four tables large, but in my opinion, the food that they serve is destined for bigger things ahead. Join me in this homely episode where I taste a full-fledged veg bhojanam, kodi vepudu, gongura chicken royulu roast and a memorable Hyderabadi style biryani.

In this episode, I seek out a dosae memory from 20 years ago! A unique reddish-orange-hued dosae that found its home in the erstwhile Samrat restaurant at Chalukya Hotel, Bengaluru. Sadly, the place closed its doors a few months ago, however second generation restaurateur, Santosh Shanbag is committed to preserving the near 50-year-old culinary legacy of his father. I caught up with him and also a masterclass in the technique that goes into the making of their signature Chalukya Samrat ghee roast dosae. 

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Bengaluru‚Äôs Famous But Hidden CHANDRAPPA HOTEL! 46 Years Of Non Vegetarian Tradition! Must Try!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67_1nM1ix_0,"#chandrappahotel #nonvegetarian #bangalore

When Mr. Chandrappa moved to Mathikere, then a remote corner of Bengaluru nearly half a century ago, he set up a vegetarian eatery to cater to the local populace. This met with limited success, however things clicked when he added in the non vegetarian dishes that he and his wife would cook at home. Eventually, his sons joined in to support this family enterprise that in a span of 46 years has come to be the de facto eatery for naati (local style) non-vegetarian oota in the area. However, there are still many outside the immediate area who are yet to discover the homely taste of the fare here. I was one of them, until I paid a surprise visit one afternoon. In doing so, I caught up with the second and third generation of Chandrappa‚Äôs family and also his culinary legacy in a smorgasbord of meaty dishes.

Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

In our last Old Delhi outing this season, we stumbled upon the best biryani that we tasted in the walled city. Getting to Taufiq Dilpasand Biryani Point requires some effort given its location in the inner recesses of Galli Haveli Azam Khan, a bit of a walk from Jama Masjid. The shop itself is a little more than a window, but the biryani that emerges from the copper pots here has endeared itself to biryani lovers in the know for a quarter of a century now. Hope you enjoy this one too.

They call Haji Mohd Hussain‚Äôs fried chicken the KFC of Old Delhi, a moniker well earned by the hard working septuagenarian for his single minded focus to making his version of a double fried, crisp and juicy, spicy chicken. Speaking of one-dish eateries, further down the road, one also finds Shabrati Nahari Shop that has been making a slow-braised eight-hour nahari twice a day each day since 1954. And in between the fried chicken and nahari, I also gulped down a few glasses of mohabbat ka sharbat, a delightful refreshing concoction that I instantly fell in love with. 

Hope you love this episode too. Subscribe and hit the bell to stay tuned for a couple more in our Old Delhi series. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Park aside whatever notions you may have of the butter chicken, for Purani Dilli‚Äôs most famous Aslam Butter Chicken is anything but that. Made to a seemingly simple recipe with secret masalas, this roasted and charcoal grilled chicken bathed in copious amounts of molten butter has built for this Jama Masjid eatery an iconic status over a span of 25 years. We catch the making of this indulgent chicken tikka, but before that take respite in the reinvigorating offerings of a tea stall that goes back seven or eight decades. 

Hope you enjoy this episode. Subscribe and hit the bell to stay tuned for a couple more in our Old Delhi series. Take care; stay safe and strong. 

Happy eating!

What began as Mrs. Geetha Shivakumar‚Äôs home cooking initiative 23 years ago to bridge with farmers and bring a seasonal produce to Bengaluru‚Äôs consumers in a myriad range of savoury and sweet delicacies is now a culinary institution called the Avarebele Mela. Farmers congregate from Magadi, Karnataka bringing the pick of their crops and the cooks from Shree Vasavi Condiments cook up a host of preparations, each one featuring the avarebele. I was recently invited to open this festival with a host of other dignitaries including Mrs. Sudha Murthy, Sihi Kahi Chandru Sir and others. Hope you enjoy this vlog account of my experience there. The mela runs through 9th January 2023 at National College Grounds, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru.

Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

That the Changezi chicken was created as an ode to a Mongol invader may be folklore, but we definitely found in this ‚Äòroasted chicken in gravy‚Äô a dish that conquered our palates at Al Jawahar, a fabled eatery near Jama Masjid, Old Delhi. Alongside other Mughlai fare, we also tasted a unique Shahi Sheermal, a rich, fortified bread cooked in a tandoor at Haji Nizamuddin.

In the second part of my Mavalli Tiffin Rooms morning with the inimitable Rocky Singh, we touch upon some important aspects of food that we take for granted especially at legacy eateries. We speak of the change in culinary ingredients, the fact that food preparations too have their own unique personalities, the effort it takes to preserve traditions and also discuss Rocky‚Äôs love for the dosae and bisi bele bath amongst other interesting things. 

Hope you also caught the first part of this tiffin talk at https://youtu.be/iMyRs_tSU_Q 
Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

I recently met Rocky SIngh of the Rocky & Mayur duo, one of the country‚Äôs earliest and perhaps most recognised food and travel personalities. Invited to his hit show,  #RoadTrippinWithRocky where we enjoyed a delicious Bengaluru breakfast at Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, I seized the opportunity to chat much about food, food reviews, culinary legacies, and also the one question that many of their followers have been asking of him: Where Is Mayur? 

Hope you enjoy this fun tiffin talk, stay tuned for the second part of this conversation. Happy eating!

When it comes to desi ghee mithai in Old Delhi, all roads lead to 120-year-old Chaina Ram Sindhi Halwai. And for good reason. Almost everything we tasted here - kachori aloo, paneer pakora, ghewar, milk cake, karachi halwa - were the sort that deserved special mention. And so did the dahi bhalla at Natraj, yet another Chandni Chowk icon.

In this sweet and savoury episode, we cover three must-visit Old Delhi favourites. Our first stop is at Hazari lal Jain Khurchan Wale where we taste the pure dairy goodness of a traditional reduced milk dessert and some more. This is followed by a piquant introduction to Old Delhi‚Äôs famous Lotan Chole Kulche. This is perhaps the spiciest chole that I have tasted, and the reason, I am told, for its popularity especially in Delhi‚Äôs nippy winters. Our last halt, Padam Chaat comes as a wonderful respite for its tantalizing chaats that work marvelously well to tease our taste buds with a broad array of textures and delicate flavours. 

Hope you enjoy this one too, lots more coming up in this exciting food tour. Subscribe to stay tuned, Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

One serves a scrumptious ghee soaked jalebi with thick rabri, and the other revels in its incredible variety of paranthas, that are decadently fried in pure desi ghee.

"SURYAWANSHI, A Family‚Äôs Devotion to True MAHARASHTRIAN Food | Throwback",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nph1QBMHDg,"#suryawanshi #maharashtriancuisine #bengaluru

Authentic Maharashtrian Food at Suryawanshi Restaurant, Bengaluru, Bangalore, Kolhapuri Mutton, Mutton Thali, Pune Vegetarian Food, Pandra Rasa, Tamba Rasa, Misal pav, Vada Pav, Sabudana Vada, Whitefield, Bangalore, Prawn Fry, Pomfret Fry, Malvan Fish Curry, eating out in bengaluru, bangalore,  food trail, must try restaurant 

When Kailash Suryawanshi moved from Kolhapur to Bengaluru with his family nearly a decade ago, the one cuisine he couldn‚Äôt get any of was his own. Such was his yearning for food from his land, that this entrepreneur decided to take upon himself the onerous task of introducing Bengaluru to authentic Marathi fare. After months of travel through the hinterlands of Maharashtra, gleaning recipes and cooks, Suryawanshi was born, a restaurant where conversations in Marathi waft through the dining room, as if in endorsement of the food served here.

In this throwback #gourmetontheroad episode, I catch up with the Suryawanshi family and also tuck into some delicious Maharashtrian cuisine, tasting everything from Pandra Aani Tambda Rasa, Misal Pav, Sabudana Vada, Puneri Veg Thali, Kolhaprui Mutton Thali, Puran Poli, Amras, Shrikhand and more. Enjoy!

Special VEGETARIAN MEALS At SRI SAI VIHAR | SALEM | Puli Kuzhambu | Veg Biryani | Throwback,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxPUL3nYtnc,"#srisaivihar #vegetarian #salem

Sri Sai Vihar at Fairlands in Salem, was an eatery that came recommended for its meals and tiffin items. The restaurant that features an all-vegetarian menu had humble beginnings, starting out as a mess that served Tamil meals over 40 years ago. 

In this throwback episode, we savour the special meal served here. One that is loaded with wholesome dishes, each delicious and distinct in its flavours. And what makes it a great lunch option is the fact that it's unlimited and honestly priced!

Zain‚Äôs Hotel Kozhikode stands testament to Mrs Zainabi Noor‚Äôs firm resolve to showcase the Mappila cuisine of her family. Kozhikode‚Äôs first lady restaurateur, she began her culinary enterprise 32 years ago as a small tea stall dispensing evening snacks. Spurred by the love she received from her customers, Zain‚Äôs today stands tall in Calicut as the address for homestyle Malabar cuisine.

In this throwback episode, I visit  this cosy restaurant set in a home and meets the mother-daughter duo of Zainabi Noor and Shireen Mustafa who oversee every detail of the operation. And also look at the making of their popular chicken biryani, ghee rice and chicken masala in their kitchen ‚Äòmanned‚Äô only by lady cooks, before sitting down to a generous lunch.

Tasting The Mumbai PAV BHAJI At SHIV SAGAR Bengaluru! Throwback,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxQTNr5sYUA,"#shivsagar #pavbhaji #bangalore

shiv sagar, mumbai pav bhaji, bengaluru, pav bhaji making, vegetarian restaurant, eating out in bangalore, bengaluru food trail, vegetarian, popular restaurant

A dish that finds its origins in leftover vegetables tossed by street vendors into an inexpensive but tasty mash and served with local bakery bread as cheap sustenance to Bombay‚Äôs mill workers at the turn of the last century, the pav bhaji evolved to its buttery, cheesy, somewhat indulgent avatar courtesy savvy restaurateurs in the seventies and eighties. My memories of a Mumbai pav bhaji go back to Shiv Sagar, Juhu and Vile Parle, a hop and a skip away from college, where I relished many a plate. So when a craving for the Mumbai style pav bhaji hit me one cold evening, I found my way to the Bengaluru outpost of Shiv Sagar, where brothers Ram and Shyam, second generation restaurateurs trained in the Mumbai restaurant, dish up this quintessential Mumbai fast food that is quite close to the real deal. 

Hope you enjoy this throwback episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Famous AHMEDIA VANIYAMBADI BIRYANI New 250-seat Restaurant On Bengaluru Chennai Highway!

47 years ago, Janab Ahmed Basha Sahib set up a modest eatery in Vaniyambadi, a town in Tirupattur district of Tamil Nadu, famous for its leather industry. The fare at Ahmedia Hotel was mostly Mughlai,  inspired by the culinary traditions of erstwhile North Arcot principality. Over decades the kitchens here have perfected time-honored recipes, amongst them a wood-fire-cooked biryani that, unusual for Tamil Nadu, favours the basmati over seeraga samba rice. I discovered Ahmedia three years ago on a #gourmetontheroad tour through the region when I met the founder and his enterprising sons. Janab Ahmed Basha has passed on since, but his sons seem determined to build on their father‚Äôs legacy. And have now opened a massive 25,000 sq. ft., 250-seat Ahmedia branch on the Bengaluru Chennai highway with the conveniences required to cater to travellers. I visited them on a recent trip to Chennai, where I tasted most of my favourite dishes here, including the biryani that has put Vaniyambadi on the culinary map.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

I recently received an invitation that compelled me to drive 350 kilometres to visit the Adyar Ananda Bhavan Sweets & Snacks Factory in Ambattur, Chennai. A2B, as the group is popularly known, is now perhaps South India‚Äôs most recognised restaurant, sweets and snacks brand, with over 150 outlets across Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and overseas, however its origins are rather humble and trace an agricultural family‚Äôs inspiring 60-year journey through Rajapalyam, Bengaluru, Chennai and beyond. As I learnt from the second and third generation of the Adyar Ananda Bhavan family when I visited their facility that can produce over 40,000 kilos of savouries and 10,000 kilos of sweets evry single day! 

What is heartening though is the family‚Äôs commitment to sourcing quality ingredients, even making their own ghee to ensure 100% purity, and fostering an environment where the skill and craft involved in making artisanal handmade sweets is also encouraged alongside automated production lines to meet the burgeoning demand for their sweets and savouries. I hope you enjoy the first part of this very special episode this Deepavali weekend.

Happy Diwali! Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Nearly 100 Years, UDUPI SRI KRISHNA BHAVAN Is Bengaluru‚Äôs Best Kept Secret! Sagu Dosae, Best Sambar",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNpU3b6JUzI,"#udupisrikrishnabhavan #balepete #bangalore

Although established at its present location in 1926, its culinary provenance dates back to the early 1900s. One of Bengaluru‚Äôs oldest eateries, Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan has not received the kind of recognition other eateries of its ilk have perhaps due to its location amidst the hustle and bustle of Balepete. The food here is prepared the old-fashioned way, not the sort that swims in rivers of ghee or is buried under mounds of butter, khoa, or other such dairy decadence. Which is good, especially if you want to indulge, sans any guilt, in its tasty South Canara fare, like many of its regular patrons, some who have been visiting for 50 years! I soak in some charming old-world vibe as I make a tasty meal of some of their must-try dishes including a scrumptious, very popular sagu dosae and perhaps the most impressionable sambar you will find in this city. A sambar that we also watched the making of.

When Mrs. Padma and her husband, Prakash mulled the idea of a new street food enterprise in the throes of the pandemic to stay afloat, they thought it would be unique to introduce the pizza but in a flavourful avatar that would resonate the punchy flavours that people expect in street fare. And thus was born Amma‚Äôs Italian Pizza, first on a cart and now a van. Padma Amma experimented with vegetarian topping combinations for days on end at her home, also sharpening her secret recipe for a piquant pizza sauce, a sprightly medley of herbs, spices, sour, sweet and heat. From a spiced-up Margherita to a Karnataka pizza that basically incorporates almost every ingredient she has available, Amma‚Äôs pizzas are slowly but surely gaining favour with the locals of Koramangala, South Bengaluru for her hygienic approach to using fresh quality ingredients and creating flavours of the sort that appeal to most mainstream palates. The name may say ‚ÄòItalian‚Äô, but these are the sort of pizzas that resonate the ‚Äòkadak‚Äô, street vibes of namma ooru, Bengaluru.

After picking up recipes from a stint in a Maratha military hotel kitchen in Bengaluru, Rajanna, a native of Kunigal, began serving non vegetarian meals in a small shed off Magadi Road in Vijayanagar 36 years ago. The menu comprised only nine items, mostly mutton, cooked by Rajanna himself with a single masala that would be ground by him at home. He passed on shortly after, but his wife and brother in law have continued his work over decades, preserving the flavour and character of the food. From a shed, it is now a tiny eatery, sans any name board, where customers queue up for rustic, village style fare served on banana leaves off granite slabs that serve as benches and tables. A recent addition also includes a basic but functional family room. I caught up with my chef friend, Sushil Dwarkanath to explore the cooking here and also make a tasty meal of their mutton delicacies. If you love meaty, rustic flavours, this is the place to savour it. 

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Gautham Reddy, a DJ, and his wife, Christine, a pastry chef, suddenly found themselves out of work due to the pandemic, they put together their savings into a culinary enterprise, a caf√©, that met with limited success. Lesson learnt, they turned next to a home delivery business focused on non vegetarian fare derived from family recipes. Orders followed, giving them the confidence to set up a tiny eatery in the suburb of Vidyaranyapura. Things have been slow though, and when they reached out to us to help spread the word, we stepped in for a surprise visit one Wednesday afternoon. Manned by an all-women team, the fare here is the sort that is homely, tasty and most importantly, honestly priced. We tasted around 10 dishes, the sort that would happily feed a hungry party of four, and worked up a bill of just over Rs. 1200. I hope you have the heart to support enterprises like these that are committed to honest work, and trying to do their best to stay afloat in these trying times.

Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"This Tiny, Hidden 30-Year-Old PUNJABI PURE VEG Serves Honestly Priced Amritsari Khaana In Bengaluru!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESGpv0FsxIk,"#punjabifood #chickpet #bangalore

Over 30 years ago, Dinesh Sood and his brother Deepak Sood, originally from Ludhiana, set up a tiny four-table eatery in the old market area of Balepet, Bengaluru to serve North Indian khaana to traders and travellers who would visit the area. Gaining popularity over time, Punjabi Pure Veg moved to a slightly larger first floor nook eventually, where it still stands 28 years on. The ambience, service and the decor is rather basic, but it is the rustic flavours of the food dished out by second generation owner, Aman Sood and his motley retinue of cooks that seems to hold sway over regular patrons. Also, the fact that the fare is delightfully cheap further adds to its draw. Hope you enjoy this one, visit here only for the food, nothing else.

Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"These Young Lady Chefs Are Cooking Their Mother‚Äôs Recipes In College! 30 Naidu, Mudaliar, UP Dishes!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcuvKMIWClY,"#christuniversity #studentrestaurant #bangalore

christ university, bangalore, student restaurant, young chefs, lady chefs, mudaliar cuisine, naidu cuisine, uttar pradesh cuisine, student cooking, young chefs, bangalore food tour, eating out in bengaluru

I was recently invited to a delicious initiative spearheaded by the Department of Hotel Management at Christ University, Bengaluru, where students operate an Indian restaurant every Friday. I went in expecting, well, the sort of meal that would be cooked by chefs in learning, but was simply blown away by the depth and sheer variety of traditional dishes that these young students had prepared from scratch to their mother‚Äôs recipes. If this is what our upcoming chefs are capable of, surely, our culinary traditions are in good hands. 
If you manage to get in on this rather limited-seats experience, certainly something to check out. Hope you enjoy this special episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A couple of years ago, I had visited Kumar, a trained chef, who had turned his passion for omelets into an interesting enterprise, Egg Factor, where he would dish up gourmet ‚Äòeggy‚Äô creations out of a tiny stall in HSR Layout, South Bengaluru. Soon after the video was released, customers turned up in plenty to support him and it looked like nothing could go wrong. Until he arrived one morning to find his streetside eatery demolished without notice, and to make matters worse, the pandemic followed soon after. Today, Kumar and his wife, Rajalakshmi are once again trying to rebuild their lives and their small omelet  business with a borrowed push cart that is parked outside a supportive store. Hope you enjoy this episode. Do try your best to support fledgling businesses like this that are going through tough times. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!


Note: each omelet is made of four eggs and can easily serve two, or perhaps even three people with modest appetites. Please keep this in mind when considering prices here.

"Found This Small Eatery In This Farmer Couple‚Äôs Home! HOTEL KARAVALI FISH LAND, Mudigere",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eFxTl_NihE,"#seafoodrestaurant #mudigere #karavalifishland

karavali fish land, home eatery, homely seafood, mudigere, spice town, ganganamakki, mudigere, hassan charmadi highway, seafood lunch, traditional fish curry, fish fry, crab ghee roast, kande fry, kodai fry, disco fish fry, pullimunchi, mangalorean cuisine, food trail, karnataka food tour, support local, support small business

We stumbled into this tiny home eatery in Mudigere run by a young couple, Ravi and Vidya Pujari who began this to supplement their marginal coffee growing income. The food is Mangalorean, revolving around seafood that is procured fresh. We landed on the second Saturday of a month, a day when they supposedly don‚Äôt have too many customers and therefore do not procure a large variety of seafood. But what we tasted was the sort that was satisfying enough. The fries may have been slightly overdone, but was tasty nonetheless and the curries the sort that hit the spot along with a pleasing crab ghee roast. What‚Äôs nice overall is the warming hospitality with which the couple serve you in their modest eatery. Definitely a lunch spot to try should you be in and around Mudigere in Karnataka. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It has been over 15 years since I last visited Brittos. A lot has changed in and around this 57-year-eatery since.

Known as the macher rani, or the queen of fish, the hilsa, or ilish, is a prized monsoon delicacy for Bengalis. And when I learnt from Chef Subhankar Dhar about a hilsa festival underway at his restaurant, Esplanade, with prized specimens of the fish caught in the Padma river of Bangladesh, which incidentally is where most of the fish originate, I wasted no time in meeting him. We caught up over a delicious repast of hilsa dishes, an insightful introduction to this prized fish, and a showcase of Bengali cuisine‚Äôs delightful nuances. Hope you enjoy this episode as much as I did. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Dining off tables and stools arranged on the sidewalk, Sandeep‚Äôs clientele is a democratic mix of Goa, from the elite to the daily wage earners, for whom a plate of his xacuti gravy laden egg dish is bliss and the sort that Sandeep says,  ‚Äúguarantees a good night's sleep.‚Äù Hope you enjoy this street food episode.

Eshwar Rao entered the kitchen of a generations-old military hotel when he was barely into his teens. It was here that he learnt age-old Karnataka-Maratha recipes from his mentor, Rukmini Bai over decades of diligent labor, that he now serves up in his rustic eatery, S G Rao‚Äôs Military Hotel in Cottonpet, Bengaluru. I met this entrepreneur, now in his forties, and caught the making of a unique military style pulav, in addition to a tasting of some of the other must-haves here. The pulav here is cooked only with the gravy of the meat, the meat that is then layered under the rice just before serving. And interestingly, the chicken pulav too is cooked in any mutton gravy that may be available! Hope you enjoy this tasty episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

In this episode, I revisit Arogya Ahaara, an eatery that has caught the fancy of South Bengaluru‚Äôs denizens for its simple, straightforward philosophy of serving high quality, tasty nourishing fare at prices that do not pinch one‚Äôs pocket in the least. As a result, people throng here all times of the day, be it for breakfast, lunch, evening tiffin for dinner. This time around, I tasted their ‚Äòdumdaar‚Äô North Indian meal, priced at only Rs. 95 and the sort that provides tasty, well balanced sustenance and notably without sitting heavy on the stomach and lulling diners into a state of slumber. Though limited in its price, the meal packs plenty, a nourishing lentil preparation, paneer curry, choice of breads, palav, freshly cut salads, raitha, a lassi and even a dessert in the form of a modestly-sized motichoor ladoo. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

This 40-year-old eatery‚Äôs unkempt, garage shed sort of appearance, in sharp contrast to the well-kept decor of restaurants on the Goa tourist trail, may leave the first time visitor a bit perplexed, but I was told that when it comes to the local‚Äôs preferred haunt for fresh seafood, Sharada Bar & Restaurant, now named Gopal Bar after the owner‚Äôs demise a year ago, stands tall. And so I discovered during my visit here, incidentally I was the only tourist on the premises, over a delicious lunch of drumstick prawn curry, clams, mussels, oysters and chonak masala fry. The sort of soulful fare that helps one get past the rustic vibe of the place. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Tasted This Delicious GHEE ROAST Village IDLI! GANGADHAR Kesaramadu IDLI HOTEL, Tumkur",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzpqirqhbC0,"#kesaramaduroastidli #thatteidli #tumkur

Gangadhar, real name Krishnamurthy, is a man who wears many hats - former president of the gram panchayat, farmer and eatery owner. It is the last hat though that is relevant here. 16 years ago, he set up a makeshift shed to serve the famous Kyathasandra thatte Idli but away from the bustle of the main Tumkur highway, on a narrow village road leading to a tiny hamlet, Kesaramadu. Slowly but surely the popularity of his solitary village eatery grew for its thatte Idli, dosae and simple rustic lunch that came as a boon to the farming folks around. However, four years ago some customers recommended that he try roasting the Idli in ghee, and thus was born his, now-referred-to-as, Kesaramadu Roast Idli. Thatte idlis are steamed, cooled and then slow roasted on a dosae tawa with liberal lashings of ghee. Ten minutes later, the idlis take on a delicious, buttery crust that sends the palate into raptures brought on by molten streams of ghee. And it is this idli that seems to have put Gangadhar Idli Hotel, Kesaramadu, on the food lovers map! Hope you enjoy this rustic breakfast episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"This Lady Entrepreneur‚Äôs ZAMINDAR RESTAURANT Bengaluru Is A Hit For Andhra, Biryanis, NonVeg Combos!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulYzWzZOH18,"#zamindarrestaurant #bangalore #biryani

Armed with an MBA, Harini wanted to get into the restaurant business with a concept that would serve tasty fare built on quality ingredients but at a price point that would not have pinched her purse as a student. Despite facing initial resistance to the idea from her father, she persisted, and finally after convincing her family for over six months, Zamindar Restaurant finally opened in HRBR Layout, East Bengaluru, with a menu repertoire that paid homage to her Andhra roots, biryanis, and spanning other cuisine influences to cater to Bengaluru‚Äôs cosmopolitan diners. In a relatively short span of under four years, her restaurant has carved out a significant niche for itself with its offerings that are built around the promise of ‚Äútasty fare at prices that offer maximum value‚Äù. I step into Zamindar for lunch, to meet her and her family who now support her enterprise unflinchingly and also taste some of the signature biryanis like the Hyderabadi biryani, ulavacharu biryani, gongura biryani, and other dishes that are a hit with customers. Hope you enjoy this sumptuous episode. Take care, stay safe and strong; happy eating!

A trained pastry chef by profession, Kennedy Dias worked many years overseas crafting fine cakes and pastries. However, he yearned to be back home in Caranzalem, Goa. He finally returned and mustered the courage to set up a cake shop but ‚Äúpeople didn‚Äôt understand fine pastries 20 years ago‚Äù, he says. So, after a couple of unsuccessful years, he began making puffs, pies and chops, the sort of traditional fare that locals appreciate and love. And along the way experimented with a home-smoked curry-leaf infused Goan sausage, that is now a must-try here. Since then, his tiny shop has become much popular with the locals and young students for his omelets, sandwiches, burgers, pies and interesting shakes and juices. This is the sort of honest dive that one should also visit for a true taste of small town Goa, away from the tourist trail.

Located in the heart of Panjim, Kokni Kanteen seeks to introduce guests to the Kokni, or traditional Saraswat cuisine of Goa,  in a format that is friendly and comfortable. Fitting when one learns that the bungalow it is housed in dates back to Portuguese rule and served as an inn where locals would be fed when they traveled from the villages. I step in here to savour a reasonably priced viswon (kingfish) thali and an interesting array of flavourful GSB preparations, both vegetarian and non vegetarian, that are rarely found outside homes. What began as a local haunt has now evolved to a destination where visitors can help themselves to a delicious serving of Goa‚Äôs rich and varied cuisines. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

And so when the opportunity to return to Gurudatta Bhavan, Hubli, presented itself on our recent drive to Goa, we jumped at the opportunity to savour these scrumptious snacks, some that though with roots far removed from the city have somehow come together in interesting avatars that the denizens of this city have fallen in love with over the decades. Hope you enjoy this short evening tiffin episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Must Stop Here For Famous Kadak Rotti, Enne Khara, Sappey Mutton! Hotel Nartaki Ranebennur Karnataka",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kp_lbBsg8A,"#ennekhaara #ranibennur #hotelnartaki

I had heard much about this very special Ranebennur mutton preparation, the enne  khara, translating literally to oil and chilli heat, drawing from its two principal ingredients. And so on our recent drive to Goa, we planned a lunch stop in this agricultural town in North Karnataka at Hotel Nartaki, the home of this iconic dish. Established 30 years ago by N Satish, a tailor turned restaurateur, in a tiny eatery that could only accommodate a few customers at a time. His wife would help him make the masala at home that he would cook into curries. Along the way, he came up with the concept of enne khaara largely to appease the spice-hungry tastebuds of the locals. The dish, in contrast to its fiery name, is a beautiful balance of flavours between the chilli heat (from a combination of 90% local Javannur chillies that also impart a striking colour to the dish, and 10% Guntur chillies) and the oil that rounds off all the sharp edges of the masala aided by the sourness of tomatoes. Mr N Satish has since passed on but the homemade tradition continues with his sons, Chetan and Chandan, in a much larger space today, aided by their mother and wives. If you love your meaty fare, Hotel Nartaki is certainly worth a visit, I would say even a detour should you be travelling in the area. I hope you enjoy this very special episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Found Most Delicious XACUTI MASALA At This Roadside Eatery In Goa! SAI ANANT PARRA | Ros Omelet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1vVleCyj88,"#saianant #xacuti #rosomelet

I heard from a few locals that this unassuming roadside eatery on Parra Main Road, North Goa, serves a xacuti that was worth the 20 odd kilometer drive from where we were staying in Dona Paula. But when we arrived, the chicken xacuti was over as were some other popular breakfast eats like egg chops, etc.. Nonetheless, we stepped into the kitchen to check what was available and found the remnants of a xacuti gravy that owner, Mahesh Parsekar‚Äôs mother prepares at home. The roasted spice aroma of the gravy was enticing, and so when Mahesh offered to cook a ros omelet with the gravy, I knew we had to try it. The weighty omelet was elevated a few notches by the aromatic flavours of the xacuti, and I definitely look forward to returning to Sai Anant Parra someday in the hope of tasting more of the traditional home cooked fare. Hope you enjoy this short vlog on a hidden Goa gem. Happy eating; take care, stay safe and strong.

Amazing Ice Cream Combinations At Old Bengaluru‚Äôs Family Run MANTAP ICE CREAM Sheshadripuram,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si4LW53nCBw,"#vegetarian #icecream #bangalore

An acclaimed Yakshagana artist, Prabhakara Upadhyay began Saligrama‚Äôs Mantap Ice Cream in Bengaluru in 1981 when he realized the need for a business to earn a livelihood. In those days, the denizens of (then) chilly Bangalore were hesitant to eat ice creams afraid they may fall ill, and thus began a long and arduous journey of educating people to appreciate and enjoy these frozen treats. The effort seems to have paid off over the years, making this vegetarian ice cream parlour a household name amongst old Bangaloreans. From multiple outlets, Mantap has now scaled back to only one store in Seshadripuram, where Mantapa Upadhyay, (as he is popularly known) dreams up combinations that he personally puts together each morning with dairy rich ice creams that are sourced from a premium ice cream supplier. In this conversation with him and his family, I savour a range of his delectable creations - from traditional pure organic jaggery, guava chilli, to inspirations like the fruit fusion, red velvet cake, and classics like rich mango cream and caramel, and a couple of delicious faloodas too. This store is a definite must-visit if you love ice cream.

Best Goan Seafood Thali At CAF√â RITZ  Panjim! The Man Who Made Goa‚Äôs Fish Thali World Famous!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZiUhv1mNcA,"#ritzgoathali #panjim #goaseafood

46 years ago, Rohidas Desai took over an existing taverna off Eduarte Pacheco street in Panjim to set up his seafood restaurant. Fastidious about the quality of seafood, he would visit the market each day to scour for the best marine produce to be cooked to his wife, Gokula Desai‚Äôs recipes. It is no surprise then that this committed approach had earned for Ritz legions of ardent patrons who now pack the group's six restaurants for lunch and dinner. I caught up with Daad (as he is known to everyone in Goa) Desai in a meeting that was ordained by destiny over a seafood lunch at their very first eatery, Caf√© Ritz. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Seafood Thali
Rs 200 (usd 2.6) The thali is priced at Rs. 300 (usd 3.9) in the other Ritz Classic restaurants, however the quantity and variety on the thaali too may be a bit more.

For the best traditional Goan desserts and scrumptious savoury treats, locals swear by Mr. Baker, a 100-year-old institution that remains steadfast to its culinary roots. I met with third generation owner, Nenette Fernandes, over a leisurely tasting of bebinca, battica, risoi, croquettes, the sort of baked wares that even her grandfather, Mr. Pedro Vincent Vaz who founded the bakery, would recognise if he were around today. I also discovered a delicious surprise in the Niro, a refreshing cashew juice that took me back to memories from my childhood. Hope you enjoy this short and mostly sweet episode.

They say when locals in Panjim want to catch up on the goings on around town and also some delicious vegetarian fare, they head to Caf√© Bhonsle, a 102-year-old institution that has been patronized by generations of Goans. Some aver that ‚Äúsuch is the connect that ‚ÄòPanjimites‚Äô have with this eatery that they may travel the world, but when they return to Goa, their first stop is at Caf√© Bhonsle‚Äù, presumably for the comforting food - tamata bhaji, sukhi bhaji, alsanna bhaji with poori, pav, goan samosa, mirchi and much more - and also, conversation. I enjoyed my morning here, not just the food but also an interesting t√™te-√†-t√™te with its friendly patrons. Caf√© Bhonsle is a definite must-visit when you are in Panjim, and especially to get a flavour of Goan vegetarian cuisine.

A visit to Goa is always memorable. It‚Äôs tough not to be taken in by its disarming ‚Äòsussegad‚Äô chilled-out vibe, the cheerful attitude of friendly Goans who welcome visitors with open arms, its vibrant culture and customs, and last but not the least, its food that is rich in its traditions, varied and flavourful. We stayed a week in Goa exploring its culinary fare, from meals in fabled, century-old institutions, to establishments that serve up a delightful showcase of community cuisine, Saraswat and Catholic, to uncovering some tiny unsung hole-in-the-wall joints, savoring street food and more. Stay tuned to Food Lovers TV over the next few weeks as we roll out these Goa episodes; each eatery featured a must-add to your next Goa visit. For now, here‚Äôs a preview of what‚Äôs in store. Happy eating!

A couple of weeks ago, I watched a beautiful Kannada play that not only chronicled the iconic Vidyarthi Bhavan but also brought alive the emotional connect that patrons have with this institution over the decades. Amongst the brilliant characters portrayed, a pivotal performance was that of famed actor and food legend, Sihi Kahi Chandru, who gave voice to the Vidyarthi Bhavan masala dosae, the heart of a tiffin experience at the 77-year-old eatery. In the course of our conversation backstage, Chandru Sir and I quickly decided we should savour a full tiffin at Vidyarthi Bhavan soon. This isn‚Äôt your typical Gourmet On The Road episode, but it makes an attempt to capture our experience at the breakfast that followed. Hope you enjoy this one. Take care; stay safe and strong.

Krishna Poojary migrated from his hometown in Kundapura to Bengaluru nearly half a century ago in search of a livelihood. After a string of odd jobs in eateries, he decided to try his hand at a bajji (fried fritter) gaadi (cart) in Jayanagar 4th block, Bengaluru. It‚Äôs been 42 years since; the location of his cart has changed from one street to another over the years, but the place that his fried wares occupy in the hearts and palates of his neighbourhood patrons remains constant to this day. Also perhaps making Kundapura Bonda Bajji Shop one of the area's oldest street food carts! I visited him one cloudy Bengaluru evening to taste all the bondas and bajjis he and his son have on offer. 

Hope you enjoy this episode in our ongoing initiative to support small businesses, do support your neighbourhood eateries too. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

On my last drive through the Western ghats into Mangalore, I stopped for lunch in the spice town of Mudigere, around 80 kilometres from Hassan, at an old bungalow converted into a cosy eatery. It was here that I met an incredibly hard working brother-sister duo. Kaleel makes a 240 kilometer return trip every other night to procure fresh seafood from the fishing harbour in Mangalore, that his sister Arshia single handedly cooks to family recipes. The flavours of the homely fare here is reminiscent of what you would taste in kudla (Mangalore)  but with the sort of punchy spicing that they say ‚Äúis suited to the local palate of Mudigere‚Äù. I enjoyed my meal at Kaleel‚Äôs Kitchen, hope you relish this episode too. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Sujit Lakade missed Kolhapuri Misal Pav when he moved to Bengaluru a few years ago. In this he saw an opportunity to showcase to Bengaluru the village rendition of this quintessential Maharashtrian street food staple, an approach that conveys delicious, spicy flavours with minimal fuss. And so Gavran Misal was born, with ingredients sourced from Kolhapur, given his family‚Äôs lineage in the food grains business. Here, the tari, the spicy rasa (gravy) at the heart of the dish, is cooked over a wood fire, thereby also imbuing this modest eatery, with a rustic smokey appeal, where regulars wolf down the misal pav and vada pav, the only two items served here in addition to kokum and taak (buttermilk) to wash things down. 

If you‚Äôre looking to savour some authentic rural flavours, head here. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When Mr Chenna Reddy migrated from his village in Andhra Pradesh just past the Karnataka border town of Mulbagal in the eighties, he sought employment as a cook in an Andhra eatery in Bengaluru. Such was his impressive hand at cooking, that some of his customers and associates pooled together a restaurant for him, and thus was born Mayuri in 1986, just off Minerva circle on JC Road. 36 years on, the eatery still reigns supreme for its Andhra fare, notably the vegetarian bhojanam and toothsome biryanis, the latter made to a unique recipe that employs minimal spices yet makes a terrific impact on the palate! In this episode, I catch up with Mr. Reddy as he walks me through his kitchen and preparations, his unbridled passion quite inspiring, before sitting down for a big Andhra meal comprising Mayuri‚Äôs most popular hits. Hope you find this slightly lengthy episode enjoyable, well, I certainly did üòâüòã. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

An engineer by profession, Apeksha was always interested in the food business. Backed by her husband and a friend, she took the plunge a few months ago in setting up a tiny eatery in Padmanabhanagar, South Bengaluru, where the vegetarian menu is a mix of local favourites and snack items from Dakshina Kannada. Having received a few recommendations from their patrons in the neighbourhood, I ventured out one evening to meet this young, confident entrepreneur and support her fledgling enterprise, in doing so, I taste a satisfying tiffin of idli vade served with a rather impressionable sambar, a subtly-flavoured Mangalore bun, nourishing bonda soup and some more, before rounding off my meal with an organic jaggery coffee. Hope you enjoy this episode; please do support small businesses in your neighbourhood. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Stepping into Sri Ram Bhavan at Ayodhya Hotel is akin to stepping back in time. Not just in terms of its decor but the dishes that are served here, many which are found rarely now, and that too mostly in homes that have managed to hold on to their culinary traditions. I drop in for breakfast and and make a big breakfast of many delicacies that I hadn‚Äôt tasted hitherto - like the patholi, a stuffed rice and jackfruit pancake steamed in banana leaf, thekre idli, an unusual steamed rice dumpling made with cucumber, a raw jackfruit roast, patrode, spiced and steamed colocasia leaves, and lots more. If you want to savour an old-fashioned South Canara breakfast, more specifically a GSB meal, this is the place to visit when in Mangalore. Hope you enjoy this episode.

The temple town of Murudeshwar in Uttara Kannada is a popular destination for devotees, and for its beach attractions.

The fare here is the sort that caters to a seafood craving when in the area, and does a good job at that. Hope you enjoy this short Murudeshwar outing; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Fish thali
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2)

Dating back to 1932, Sri Mahalasa Appu Shet Shop diversified into cooking egg based dishes around three decades ago. Creations like egg stumbler, a spicy assemblage of scrambled eggs, seasoned and toasted bread dices, a moist egg roll, among others have since made it a delicious habit for the denizens of Mangalore. And what better way to cool off, both from the weather, and spicy heat, than with some seasonal fruit juices and refreshing concoctions. I visited this store, now run by the third and fourth generation of the Shet family, one warm evening to make a big meal of a couple of egg snacks, a few fruit juices and a platter of fresh fruit. Appu Shet angadi certainly merits a visit when in this port city. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Enroute to Udupi, I spotted this old house on the highway in Padubidri, 30 kilometres from Mangalore, with a large signboard that announced its seafood credentials. Curious, I stopped by to discover an old 100-year-old- home with ancient doorways, elegant rosewood pillars and massive wooden beans, and in stark contrast, a rustic eatery manned by local cooks on the premises. The mostly seafood fare is fresh and the sort that makes for a tasty South Canara meal. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

During my very first Gourmet On The Road season over a couple of years ago, I visited this brave lady entrepreneur‚Äôs food truck, Halli Mane Rottis in Mangalore. Emerging through tough circumstances, her delicious Malenadu fare was winning hearts and palates in kudla and she seemed to be doing well, also winning numerous accolades for her grit and determination. However things are far from good for Shilpa and her family currently, I discovered when I chanced upon the food truck on my last visit to the city. I learnt that the family was going through a time due to the pandemic and also that Shilpa was largely confined to her home due to a serious back problem. She cooks what she can at home aided by her brother who then sells the food out of the truck with her father. Whilst their economic situation may be dire, the food that they dish out is still as delicious as before, I relished a toothsome green chicken curry, a spicy leg piece with soft akki rotti.

I hope you find it in your heart to support enterprises like Halli Mane Rottis. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Mr Balakrishna Prabhu and his wife, Sarojini began a tiny eatery in Kota, 60 years ago, then a little village enroute to Kundapur. Slowly but surely, the reputation of their tasty South Canara vegetarian fare cooked to family recipes grew not just with the support of locals, but travellers too for whom a visit to Hotel Latha was de rigueur after darshan at the famous Shri Amrutheshwari temple, located nearby. And served at prices that most would say are downright cheap in current context. Today the second and third generation father and son duo of Venkatesh and Rajesh Prabu tend to this eatery‚Äôs affairs, overlooked by the matriarch of the house, Mrs. Prabhu. I stop by for a delicious breakfast spread of menthe dosae, ragi mudde, basaaru, shavige, moode and more. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

When their 70-year-old eatery, Hotel Lakshmi Nivas, popularly known as KT Hotel, in Kalladka was demolished to make way for a flyover construction, Shivaram Holla and his wife, Mamatha resolved to bounce back as quickly as they could. Determined to hold on to the legacy left behind by their forefathers, during this difficult time, they gathered every bit of the rubble of the old structure and poured it into the foundation of their new building that has emerged just a few steps behind the original location. And they managed to do this in just under two months! I was amazed at their incredible determination to fiercely protect the Kalladka Tea and Rimjhim Coffee  tradition that has quite literally put this town, 30 kilometers outside Mangalore on the food lovers map. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

She Serves 1500 Idlis Everyday! Must-Try MAMU IDLI HOTEL Hassan | Soft Idlis & Most Spicy Chutney!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv_b2Pyh2XE,"#mamuidlihassan #breakfast #idlichutney

Mrs Prema continues in the legacy of her father, Mr Venkateshwara, who began a tiny idli hut in a bylane of Hassan adjoining the main market area. Over time the eatery moved to a tiny shop down the road, but its main offering, the idli continues to be a crowd pleaser, even 36 years on! Over 1500 of these are steamed each morning, to a unique batter that incorporates kusubalakki, urad dal and sabakki, sago pearls, in equal proportion; the Idlis are soft and sponge-like in texture to drink up the ghee that is drizzled over. It is served with a unique onion palya that is only tempered with salt and turmeric, and a fiery red chilli chutney made of peanuts, red chillies, cumin and garlic. The decor here is nothing to speak of, just some benches strewn around a tiny shed, but it doesn't seem to deter its patrons from lining up in queues to savour piping hot idlis for only the four or five hours they are open for business every morning.

I visit them impromptu one afternoon and after a warming conversation with the hosts and a quick tour of the house, sit down for a delicious meaty meal that I would gladly return to in a heartbeat.

This Famous VASU HOTEL Masala Dosa Has A 80-Year History! Most Reasonably Priced Tiffin Stop,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fY7KhiBHx4,"#vasuhotel #masaladosa #kanakapura

In 1969, P. Ramachandra Upadhyay, then barely in his teens, migrated from Saligrama, Udupi district, to Kanakapura to work in Vasu Hotel, an eatery famous even then for its masala dosae. This form of the dosae though was a foreign concept to Ramachandra, who coincidentally came from a small village called Parampalli, where the khali dosa was prepared as an offering to Lord Maha Vishnu. Notwithstanding his lack of knowledge, the young lad worked hard in the kitchen and in a span of 14 years was handed ownership of the Vasu Hotel by the then owners who wished to retire. Nearly 50 years on, this no-frills eatery located 50 kilometers from Bengaluru still reigns supreme, not just for its sumptuous masala dosae and other old-fashioned tiffin and sweet treats, but also for its honest approach to pricing. I caught up with Mr Upadhyay and his son, Janardhan on a trip back from Mysuru.

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

An eatery that began the Kamat Yatriniwas group‚Äôs foray into highway restaurants twenty seven years ago, Kamat Lokaruchi in Ramanagara serves the nourishing fare of rural Karnataka in an earthy atmosphere that seeks to connect diners to the land. Traditional staples are cooked over old fashioned stoves fuelled by wood to recreate authentic flavours of yore, the culinary philosophy employed here also shuns the use of artificial color and additives. Since they first opened doors, numerous eateries have mushroomed on the Mysuru highway, but even today, over quarter of a century later, Kamat Lokaruchi reigns supreme as one of the most popular eateries on the route. I caught up with Narayan Kamat, son of the late A. S. Kamat who established the Kamat Yatriniwas group, and also explored the kitchens and some wholesome dishes here. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Softest Thatte Idli In Temple Town At 100-Yr-Old SUBBANNA MESS, Melukote | Must-Try Breakfast",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85Q8SSFS8o,"#subbannamess #breakfast #melkote

During my lunch visit a few months ago to Subbanna Mess, a 100-year-old eatery in the temple town of Melukote in Karnataka, I happened to steal a glance at the preparation of the thatte idli batter, for breakfast the next morning. I was intrigued by the high proportion of urad dal as compared to typical idlis, and so made a mental note to return. And when we did, we were rewarded with tasting one of the softest idlis that I have ever eaten, in combination with a delicious, warming  cucumber gojju made. I also savoured their scrumptious no-onion masala dosae, again with an interesting twist, and their world-famous creations - puliyogare, bella pongal and sakkare pongal. This is a breakfast that I will gladly return to, and I hope this video makes your day too. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Must-Try USMAN DRY GOBI | Mysuru‚Äôs Most Popular Street Food, 27-Years In The Making!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAHnnzZJFA8,"#usmandrygobi #mysore #streetfood

When offered a free stall at the Mysuru Dussehra exhibition 27 years ago, Zainul Ahbideen felt he should in turn offer the city a taste of something different. And for his main ingredient, he chose the humble gobi, cauliflower, given the popularity of gobi manchurian, but in an avatar that had not been seen before. Experimenting with a spice mix he first made at home, Usman Dry Gobi emerged. It wasn't long before he moved to a street cart, and eventually a streetside stall a few years ago. Great care is taken by him and his son, Usman, to procure the right quality and size of cauliflowers, that are cleaned thoroughly and spiced with a secret masala, before being fried meticulously in a bath of hot oil. The result is the crunchiest, most flavourful dry gobi one can eat in Mysuru, and the sheer number of customers who queue up at this stall every evening stand testament to the fact that Usman‚Äôs Dry Gobi has emerged as one of this palace city‚Äôs most popular street food creations over the years. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A few weeks ago, I learnt from our viewers that acclaimed actor Ashish Vidyarthi enjoys watching Food Lovers TV, and coincidentally, this was around the time that I discovered his YouTube channel @AshishVidyarthiActorVlogs  and what struck me most about his vlogs was the positivity, love and enthusiasm that he brought to his interactions with people across milieus. And like they say, the universe sometimes conspires to bring people together, and that's exactly what happened. I hope you enjoy this very special collaborative episode, where I introduce Ashish Vidyarthi, a wonderful person to the rustic, meaty joys of Gowda cuisine, fittingly at an eatery named Gowdara Mudde Mane here in Namma Bengaluru.

Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

Note: I haven't rated this meal, as we already have an earlier episode on Gowdara Mudde Mane (link below) where you will find all details, including prices and ratings. Thank you.

"Must-Try Hubli Savaji Cuisine In Bengaluru At HOTEL SAVAJI‚ÄôS | Jowar Roti, Kaima Unde, Mutton Chops",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNH-LQEjUFU,"#hotelsavajis #bengaluru #rajajinagar

The Savaji community, settled for centuries in Karnataka, traces its ancestry to a race of warriors, originally from Maharashtra, and therefore it only seems natural that meat, especially mutton, forms an important part of their diet. 

Hotel Savaji‚Äôs Bengaluru pays allegiance to its owner, Narasingsa Kathare‚Äôs Savaji culinary roots, when he got into this business 25 years ago owing to circumstances, unable to find a job despite possessing an engineering degree and mba. He began his eatery cooking all dishes himself, wIth recipes gleaned subconsciously having watched his grandmother cook in his ancestral home in Hubli. Therefore, not surprisingly,  the flavours are the sort that one would find in a Savaji household in North Karnataka, the food cooked in a set up that quite resembles a home kitchen, not by professional chefs, but a small team of people who moved from Hubli to join Narasingsa. I step in here for a delicious meal of a sumptuous, mutton thali with the softest kaima unde, tasty chicken masala, mutton dry fry and other dishes. If you like your meaty preparations, albeit spicy, this is certainly a place to check out Savaji cuisine in Bengaluru.

This tiny eatery isnt easy to locate, hidden on the first floor of a nondescript building in a bylane of Rajajinagar. But once you ve eaten here, the flavors are the sort that will be permanently ‚Äòlandmarked‚Äô on your palate. 

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When it comes to a quintessential Chennai breakfast and tiffin ‚Äòside‚Äô dish, the vadacurry is certainly a crowd favourite, And those in the know say 64-year-old Mari Hotel in Saidapet is the place to go to get your fix of this dish that may look rather humble but is rich in the depth of flavours and textures it conveys to one‚Äôs palate. I venture out to this busy eatery to watch the making of the vadacurry and also taste some with an idli and set dosai, and return a vadacurry convert! Hope you enjoy this episode too. Take care, stay safe and strong; happy eating!

A name that stuck because of his preferred work attire, a black trouser, Mr. Rajendran‚Äôs ‚ÄòTrouser Kadai‚Äô (Kamatchi Mess) is the sort of nondescript eatery that may not beget a second look when you walk past it in Mandaveli, Chennai. However, that doesn't seem to deter its diehard fans in the least who have been flocking here for the last 45 years to savour the meaty fare that he cooks over a wood-fired stove. I visited him just before lunch hour on a Saturday to watch the making of some of the dishes, before sitting down for an enjoyable meal comprising mutton chukka, vanjaram fry, kola urundai and a scrumptious kola urundai. Hope you enjoy this episode as well; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Few would dispute the fact that when it comes to Chennai‚Äôs most popular vegetarian destination, Sangeetha Veg Restaurants seems to rule the hearts and palates of this city‚Äôs denizens. During my visits to Chennai, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to dine at a few of their branches, and have always returned impressed with the consistent quality of the fare served, whether at an outpost on the outskirts of the city or in the heart of town. In this episode, I meet the affable father-daughter duo of Mr. P. Suresh and Sanjana Suresh at their flagship Sangeetha Veg restaurant in Adyar, and discover an interesting legacy and industrious work ethic that has over the years sought to embrace various Indian culinary influences and traditions to create an unique identity for the food that is served here, that I savour in a delicious breakfast of elai adai, chikkoo kesari, ven pongal, kasi halwa, rava dosai and some more.

When in Arcot, Northeastern Tamil Nadu, those in the know make a beeline for Chettiyar Mittai Kadai, home of the legendary makkan peda that was first made here nearly two centuries ago by Govindasamy Chettiyar, inspired by a mithai that he tasted in the palace of the Nawab of Arcot. I caught up with his fifth generation, Mr. Sundaram, to find out what goes into the making of this flour and khoa dumpling stuffed with a mixture of 11 dry fruits and nuts, before being fried gently in oil over a wood fire until golden brown and then left to soak in sugar syrup. Hope you enjoy this delectable sweet episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When on the road to Chennai, this ten-year-old vegetarian eatery, Hotel Alankar, located just outside Vellore, is a must-stop for travellers on the route, not just for its aesthetically appointed interiors, but more importantly for the variety of pleasing Tamil Nadu preparations like poriyal, vatha kuzhambu, koothu, avial, sambar, sakkarai pongal, and suchlike that emerge from the kitchens here. Manned entirely by local homemakers and cooks who combine traditional recipes with cooking methods that help preserve nutrition and natural flavours of ingredients, the unlimited thali served here is the most popular lunch draw for its sheer variety and economical pricing as I discovered in this highway outing.

"Tasting The Popular JOWAR BHAKRI Meal At KAMAT BUGLE ROCK, Bengaluru! Jolada Rotti, Ennegai, Holige",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbNhJjmWRWA,"#joladarottimeals #kamatbuglerock #basavanagudi

What I find most appealing about a good North Karnataka meal is its balanced approach when it comes to nutrition, the meal components, both raw and cooked, dishes that complement and contrast, not just in taste and textures, but also in the warming and cooling impact that they have on the body. A good representation of this culinary ethos is the jowar bhakri meal served at Kamat Bugle Rock in Basavanagudi. Part of the Kamat Yatri Niwas group that first brought North Karnataka cuisine to Bengaluru in a restaurant format, this 17-year-old eatery serves a satisfying jolada rotti oota, albeit with flavours slightly tweaked to better suit the palate of this South Bengaluru suburb. Hope you enjoy this watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

When work brought Arpita and Sujoy Das to Bengaluru 13 years ago, they yearned for the flavours of Kolkata's street fare, more specifically the Calcutta kathi roll. Since they could find none, Arpita decided to open a tiny 150 square feet shop cooking and serving up this quintessential Kolkata eat-as-you-go treat. It was only a matter of time before Sujoy quit his advertising job to support this small enterprise that has since built for itself a loyal following not only for its rolls that are made completely in house, including the spice mix with a few ingredients shipped from Kolkata, but also their Kolkata style kebabs and biryani in recent times. I visit them for a late lunch and make a meal of three tasty kathi rolls.

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong; please do support businesses in your neighbourhood. Happy eating!

HR Ramaswamy Iyengar came to Bengaluru from Holenarsipur in 1956 and set up a bakery in Basavanagudi, an old market area surrounded by villages where groundnuts were cultivated. Selling a limited variety of pure vegetarian breads, buns and biscuits, the bakery fell upon hard times due to the rationing of flour and other essentials in the seventies. Faced with dire prospects, Ramaswamy Iyengar looked at the plentiful groundnut for survival and in doing so hit upon a unique recipe combining peanuts with a blend of spices that he named the Congress kadlekai, owing to the legend that during British times, secret notes were sent by Indian National Congress party workers hidden in sacks of groundnuts. I spent an afternoon with the second and third generation of the Sreenivasa Brahmins Bakery family to watch the making of the iconic Congress kadlekai and also taste some of the traditional items that make this 66-year-old institution a hit not just with locals, but also with Bengaluru diaspora across the globe who throng here for the kadlekai, nippat, khara buns, palya buns, puffs and other traditional Iyengar bakery treats.

In our continuing initiative to support small businesses, we visit Momo Shop, a passion enterprise of Ronald George who fell in love with momos whilst pursuing an advanced mountaineering course in Darjeeling, with plans to eventually join the army like his father and brother, both war heroes. Unfortunately, that wasn‚Äôt to be owing to an accident, necessitating him to switch tracks to a corporate career. However, after 11 years, he decided to return to his love for momos in 2010 and set up a tiny 100 sq. ft. shop in RT Nagar, North Bengaluru to serve the freshest momos. How fresh? Unlike typical momo shops which pre-cook and reheat momos to serve customers instantly, out here these steamed dumplings are prepared from scratch, from rolling out the dough to preparing the filling, only when an order is placed. This approach has won for Ronald a steady stream of customers over the years, facilitating his shop‚Äôs move to a slightly larger space. Hope you enjoy this episode enough to support neighbourhood eateries like the Momo Shop. Take care; stay safe and strong.

Whilst many eateries are forced to cut back owing to the current situation, Bengaluru‚Äôs much-loved idli-chutney destination, Veena Stores, that began as a small condiment shop 44 years ago, has done just the opposite! It has scaled up four times in size! just so it can afford its customers more space and some relative peace of mind, valued aspects in present times, when tucking into their favourite tiffin treats here. Gone are the days when one had to struggle to order and then huddle and eat on the footpath. Instead, the store is now transformed with a dedicated ordering counter, a larger food dispensing area, indoor space, and even a traditional katte (alfresco bench) where one can sip on some coffee and take in the Malleswaram vibe. I caught up with second generation owner, Pradeep Suryanarayan, and also savoured a plate of idli vade and a couple of their other popular items. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care and stay safe.

A friend pointed him to a tiny shop on Berlie Street in Langford Town, and thus began Sudha Chaats, named after his wife, 39 years ago, to introduce Bengaluru to the joys of khasta (crisp) samosas and kachoris. The couple would cook and serve their fare piping hot; alongside the North Indian treats, their masala vada, bhajji and bonda, made interestingly with samosa stuffing, too found much favour, making their shop a popular cornerstone of the neighbourhood over time. Jawahar Lal passed on two years ago, but the tradition continues with his wife, now joined by their son, Satya Narayan. Hope you enjoy this chatpata episode. Do support neighbourhood eateries like Sudha Chats. Take care; stay safe and strong.

OG VARIAR & SONS | This Iconic 70-Year Bengaluru Bakery Is Bridging Tasty Traditions With Health!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMck2RaLP6c,"#ogvariarandsons #bakery #bangalore

OG Variar & Sons Bakery, popularly known as Variar Bakery, traces its roots to 1954 when O Govinda Variar, a native of Kannur, Kerala, set up a small bakery in Guttahalli, Northwest Bengaluru, selling breads and buns. Eventually he moved to Rajajinagar in 1970 before opening a second bakery on Chord Road, West Bengaluru. What makes Variar bakery immensely popular with locals is its philosophy that ‚Äúexcludes artificial additives, preservatives and chemically bleached flour in its vast range of baked products.‚Äù As a result, ‚Äúthere is no shining in our items,‚Äù says second generation owner, Vijaya Shankar, who is currently on a quest to substitute, to the extent possible, detrimental fats with healthier options of unrefined oil, ghee, butter across most of their range, and in certain products, maida with wholewheat flour and grains. I spent the better part of a day exploring the bakery and tasting many of the must-haves at this institution that has spawned many imitators. Hope you enjoy this slightly extended, but toothsome watch. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

An institution that dates back to the 60s, stepping into Woodlands Hotel transports one back to yesteryear, with its old fashioned dining rooms that carry an air of nostalgia and the aroma of comforting Mangalorean vegetarian fare served by uniformed waiters, some perhaps as old as the establishment itself. However, it is the large parking lot that seems to be the preferred dining spot, weather permitting, with Mangaloreans looking for a breakfast or evening snack in the convenience of their cars. Which is what we did on our way out of Mangalore the last time around. Hope you enjoy this snacky watch. WIsh you a fantastic 2022; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Our Favourite Bengaluru Idlis - Pt 1 | Popular Idlis Of Bengaluru!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWmppYwHYSU,"#topidlis #bangalore #breakfast

People often say we are partial to idlis, and rightfully so :-) We love our idlis and rather unabashedly at that. Tell us about a great idli stop and we won't waste much time getting there. As the year draws to a close, we thought it would be fitting to draw up a list of some of the most memorable idlis we have tasted in namma Bengaluru. We spent many hours sifting through our idli episodes to find those that have endeared to Idli lovers in the city consistently over time; here‚Äôs the first in a two-part episode that‚Äôs a must-watch if you love your idlis too. 
Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ps. the list is in alphabetical order, eaterywise. Stay tuned for part two and do let us know if there‚Äôs an idli that you feel should have been a part of the list too!

"Delicious Neer Dosa And Homemade Curries In Kottigehara Village, Charmadi At 48-Year-Old ANIL HOTEL",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb4yVTqbogw,"#anilhotel #kottigehara #neerdosa

A tiny village located atop the Charmadi ghat in Mudigere taluk of Karnataka, Kottigehara was a mere bus stop on this old route to Dakshina Kannada. Travellers would stop here for a few minutes and if hungry, would saunter off to one of the few home eateries on this remote, narrow strip of highway. And perhaps because its quick batter, water-like in its consistency, required almost no prep when an unexpected guest walked in, the neer dosae (neer meaning ‚Äòwater‚Äô in kannada) quickly became the staple offering of this village centered around a bus stand. Whist many neer dosa stalls have mushroomed since, the oldest home eatery here is Anil Hotel, begun by Mrs. Mary 48 years ago and now managed by her son, Baby and his wife, Theresia. Famous for its honestly-priced homestyle curries, tasty preparations and warming hospitality that I first experienced a year ago, I learnt that the eatery was recently rebuilt after being demolished in highway expansion causing untold challenges to the family. In this episode, we revisit this tiny enterprise to not just savour their fare for the day but to also support them as they make a new beginning despite having a legacy of nearly half a century. 

Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

In her tiny eatery, just off the highway in Sakleshpur, Mrs. Vishalakshi Lokesh cooks homestyle non vegetarian fare - biryani, khaima unde, mutton chops, chilli chicken, etc. - to recipes she learnt decades ago from her mother in Bengaluru, but accommodating ingredients more suited to native Malenadu tastes. The result is comforting, tasty food that not only has its share of customers amongst the local populace, but also draws in travellers on the route. This enterprise that she began with her late husband, Mr. Lokesh, 21 years ago, supported by son Sujith today, may seem a bit rustic in its aesthetics, but more than makes up for it in the honest, homely appeal of a meal here. Hope you enjoy this episode enough to support small enterprises like Durgashree Mess. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

"‚ÄòCheap & Best‚Äô South Canara Breakfast | Indra Bhavan Mangalore | Sajjige Avalakki, Moode, Ambode‚Ä¶",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIgrIWGv-Z8,"#indrabhavan #mangalore #vegetarian

Mangalore flocks to Indra Bhavan for its delicious South Canara tiffin at prices that don't pinch one‚Äôs pocket in the least. And just because the fare is priced low, doesn‚Äôt mean the eatery cuts corners in any aspect; this near 70-year-old institution prides itself on sourcing the best ingredients and following hygiene protocols that were laid down by its founders decades ago. And as if to validate this, most items run out in a matter of a couple of hours, consumed by regulars who come here during the morning and evening sessions to savour their favourite Indra Bhavan treats which are made at specific times. This was my second visit here, this time to taste a combination of their delicious avalakki sajjige, a comforting ‚Äòleaf-steamed‚Äô moode and a couple of other equally interesting dishes. Hope you enjoy this Mangalorean tiffin episode. Take care, stay safe and strong; happy eating!

"Must-Try ‚ÄòTyson‚Äô CHICKEN SUKKA At HINDU MILITARY HOTEL, Mangalore | 64-Year Eatery | Chilli Chicken",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgmNTo1Ohjg,"#chickensukka #hindumilitaryhotel #mangalore

The humble chicken sukka, made popular by permit rooms in erstwhile Bombay, is a rather underrated Mangalore export,, when compared appeal-wise to its more seductive siblings like the ghee roast, etc. Which is perhaps also the reason why this unpretentious eatery in Kodialbail, Mangalore, although in existence for 64 years and popular with locals, isn't much known to those visiting. I stepped in one evening for a quick chat with the affable owner, Mr. Udayshankar, and also tasted their much-sought-after chicken sukka made to a 40-year-old recipe with an interestingly named ‚ÄòTyson‚Äô chicken!  Hope you enjoy this short and simple episode. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ice Cream Legend Pabba‚Äôs Latest i THALI! Tasting With 3 Generations At New PABBA‚ÄôS IDEAL CAF√â,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dnv-A36l6oY,"#pabbasmangalore #icecream #mangalore

Say the word, ‚ÄòPabba‚Äôs‚Äô to anyone in Mangalore, or someone who has had the opportunity to visit this port city, and one is most likely to be met with a smile or in the very least, warming thoughts of  wistfulness. For very few, if at all any, in Kudla may have escaped to the alluring charm of the gadbad, tiramisu, parfait, bella candy and scores of other delicious ice cream creations concocted by S. Prabhakar Kamath, affectionately known as Pabba to family and friends, over half a century at his now iconic Mangalorean institution, Pabba‚Äôs and Ideal Ice Creams. On my visit to kudla nearly a couple of months ago, I had the opportunity to sit with him (after nearly 20 years), his son, Mukund, and grandson, Mohith, to taste their latest creation, the I. Thali, a tantalising ice cream take on the South Indian thali, at their newest parlour, Pabba‚Äôs Ideal Caf√©, Bharath Mall, that seems to have taken Mangalore by storm going by the sheer numbers that queue outside this large restaurant. However little did I know then, that this would be my last meeting with him! This episode was conceived as a review of the I Thali, but is now in some ways a tribute to the man who put Mangalore and his legendary ice creams on the culinary map. 

Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

South Canara has its share of seafood eateries, but then, there are some that have endeared themselves to diners over decades by virtue of being true to the traditions they follow. One such popular seafood stop is Hotel Mahalaxmi, in the fishing village of Malpe, about six kilometres from Udupi, where Mrs. Pushpavati Bangera, the matriarch of this family run restaurant that began as a tiny hut, has been cleaning the fish and preparing the masala for the fish curry and fry each day for the last 60 years. I catch up with her and her son, Vishwanath Bangera before I sit down to a satisfying fish thali meal.

Although only a couple of decades old, it seems like Mahesh Prasad has been a part of Mysore's culinary scene forever. Hugely popular with locals for its all day vegetarian offerings, and I suspect, also for its cosy, homely setting that conveys to diners the comforting, gold ole vibes of yesteryear, I stopped by to savour a wholesome vegetarian thali, that finds its culinary roots in South Canara albeit in a flavour tone that is suited to local preferences, a delicious bonda soup, a dish that doesn‚Äôt get nearly the recognition it deserves, and some more. Hope you enjoy this watch; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

K. N. Vasudeva Adiga‚Äôs Paakashala chain of restaurants may be relatively new, but those in the know speak volumes of his and his family‚Äôs culinary legacy that spans decades. Son of Shri K V Nagesh Rao and Smt. K N Saraswati of the iconic Brahmin‚Äôs Coffee Bar, a young Vasudeva Adiga chose to forge his own path in 1984 thereafter establishing a string of successful South Indian eateries. His relatively recent venture, Paakashala, although only a few years old, has amassed for itself a solid reputation built on ‚Äúhis promise‚Äù of serving tasty vegetarian fare with an eagle-eye focus on hygiene. Exactly what I discovered when I ventured out to their Mangalore highway outpost at Yediyur, a 100-kilometre drive from Bengaluru.

"Tasting The Buyyanadoddi Village Fish Fry | Spicy Jilebi Fry | MAHESH FISH FRY, Halaguru, Mandya",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TKDQZGdrh0,"#fishfry #buyyanadoddi #mandya 

popular village fish fry, woodfire fish fry, buyyanadoddi fish fry, buyyanadoddi, 80 kilometres from bengaluru, bangalore, halaguru, mandya district, buyyanadoddi fish, tilapia fish, jilapia fish, jilebi fish fry, village experience, buyyanadoddi fish fry maragowdanahalli karnataka 

Native to Africa and Middle East, and imported first into the country decades ago as part of a food security programme, the tilapia, a rather productive species of fish, came to be known as jilapia in native tongues, eventually acquiring the moniker ‚Äòjilebi‚Äô meenu or fish. And the tiny village of Buyyanadoddi in Mandya district, 90 kilometres outside Bengaluru, is making ripples with food lovers for its ‚Äújilebi‚Äù fish fry. 

The fish is caught fresh from streams in the area, marinated and then tawa fried over a wood fire, slathered continuously with a spicy green chilli paste and liberal sprinklings of crushed pepper, in a clutch of home eateries here. And over the years, its appeal seems to be catching on not just with locals but also Bangaloreans looking for a tasty outing and to experience Buyyanadoddi‚Äôs rustic appeal. 

Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Jilebi Fish Fry

"World Famous Puliyogare, Sakkare Pongal Of Melukote | SUBBANNA MESS | 100 Year Culinary Tradition!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86ZqjzhVhoQ,"#iyengarcuisine #vegetarian #melkote

100 year old vegetarian eatery in melukote, temple town, mandya district, pandavapura taluk, iyengar food, iyengar cuisine, brahmin cuisine, puliyogare, sakkarai pongal, bela pongal, sambar, rasam, banana leaf lunch, traditional meal, karnataka

Located around 150 kilometres from Bengaluru, the temple town of Melukote is home to culinary traditions that have evolved over centuries. Many say that quintessential Iyengar delicacies such as the sakkarai pongal, bela pongal and puliyogare trace their roots to this sacred town where one modest eatery, Subbanna Mess, has been serving traditional Melukote cuisine for nearly a century to pilgrims who journey here. In this episode, I explore the making of the puliyogare gojju, savour a delicious lunch and meet the family behind this eatery who state rather humbly, that they are merely preserving the culinary customs handed down by the generations that came before them.

Hope you enjoy this watch. Stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Ask any denizen of Mysuru for the ‚Äòtuppada dosae‚Äô hotel and chances are you will be directed to this quaint shop that has stood the test of time for over eight decades in the bylanes of Ramachandra Agrahara. Begun by Mr Hollappa in the 1940s, this breakfast-only eatery is now run by his son, 86-year old Mahadevappa, and grandson, Mahesh. The must-try (actually one of only three items on the menu) here is the scrumptious Tuppa Dosae, roasted with liberal lashings of ‚Äòvanaspati‚Äô ghee, to accommodate ‚Äútaste and budget‚Äù as pointed out by Mahesh. I dropped in for a quick chat and breakfast during a recent drive through the city. 

Hope you enjoy this watch. I take this opportunity to wish you and your loved ones a blessed Deepavali. Stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"This Popular Jayanagar TIKKI ADDA Was Born Out Of Joblessness! Must-Try Tikki Puri, Masala Bun!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uKevLDrO6I,"#chetantikkiadda #chaat #bangalore

Chetan Nagendra had to drop out of school in Mandya and move to Bengaluru to work in a factory due to financial hardships back home. However, he soon found himself without a job when the assembly line was automated. Desperate and dejected with no employment available, he went to work at his relatives' chaat cart for a meagre wage of 20 rupees a day. Eventually, it dawned upon him that he too could begin something of his own, where no one could fire him again. And thus began his streetfood venture peddling tikki puris in Jayanagar. 20 years on, Chetan‚Äôs Tikki Adda has amassed a popular local following for his scrumptious tikki puri and masala bun fare, some traditional and others inspired, as I learnt from a gaggle of food lovers on a recent visit to the neighbourhood. Hope you enjoy this episode, do support your local enterprises. Take care, stay safe and strong; happy eating!

It is no secret that out here in Bengaluru, we love our coffee, especially the traditional South Indian filter coffee kind. However, what is not much known is the fact that there are a variety of distinct coffee traditions in the South, based on geography, brewing and serving customs. But that‚Äôs about to change, as a mother and son duo, Anusuya and Ranjit Prakasam, have just opened a cosy filter coffee caf√© in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru, where they brew and serve a range of 10 filter coffees that incorporate unique blends, paired even to the milk that goes in - from hand churned to A2 milk of desi cows. I pay them a visit to taste five coffees and also some of the local bakery snacks that are served alongside. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"This Man‚Äôs Village Butter Idli & Chutney Put PANDAVAPURA On The Map! SHIVAPPA IDLI Home, Darsaguppe",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmlHcD4y8Eo,"#benneidli #idlichutney #karnataka

Pandavapura, located on the state highway between Srirangapatna and Melukote in Mandya district of Karnataka, would perhaps not have registered as a breakfast stop on the traveller‚Äôs map, but for an idli shop that goes back over three decades. Actually, it isn‚Äôt even a shop, but a window in 60-something-year-old Shivappa‚Äôs home from where he dispenses freshly steamed idlis (only) with home churned butter for a few hours each morning. Travellers on the route, and even those who journey from afar just to eat here, line up outside the window, even before it is flung open at 7am.

Shivappa‚Äôs enterprise bears no signboard and he employs no one, preferring to do everything himself, from preparing the chutney and the butter to the soaking and grinding of the grain, the fermentation and steaming of the idlis, helped only by his wife. When you are here, you need to abide by his ‚Äúseemingly authoritarian‚Äù rules - register your order, collect a token in exchange for your payment, and wait patiently for Shivappa to steam the idlis fresh and call your token number! This may seem like a bit of a drill, until you take a bite of the spicy chutney soaked idlis, and then it all seems to make sense. Like we discovered when we drove 130 kilometres from Bengaluru for breakfast recently. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating.

Invented as an unfussy double roti (bread) snack in the Kutch region of Gujarat over half a century ago, the dabeli (meaning pressed, in Gujarati) has since travelled the state and beyond, gaining popularity for its delicious composition - potatoes enlivened with a medley of spices, fruit, condiments, crunchy nuts and fritters, stuffed into a pav - that tingles with the sharpness of sweet, spicy and sour flavours. And like every other crowd-pleasing culinary creation, the dabeli too has spawned multiple avatars, this street cart that I visited had over 10, including a decadent double butter, cheese and dry fruit loaded version too. But it was the original, non-pretentious Kutchi Dabeli, resonating in its myriad flavours and textures, dished out by Yogesh Rathod at his Dabeliwala.com streetfood enterprise that made the most memorable impression on my palate. Hope you enjoy this scrumptious episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

A popular go-to snack for locals in Belagavi is the Alepaak - a medley of puffed rice, peanuts, coconut flakes, fresh coriander et al over which is crumbled a spicy putaani (chickpea flour) laddu - in the ‚Äòsweet‚Äô company of a freshly extracted sugarcane juice. And Sheetal Rasvanti Gruha seems to be the adda to partake of this Belagavi tradition. Which is exactly what we did one rain-soaked evening during our recent dash into the city. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Tasting Davanagere‚Äôs Favourite Mutton Oota At BHARANI FAMILY RESTAURANT | Mutton Chops, Kheema, Dry",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=co5WglbXJCo,"#bharanifamilyrestaurant #davanagere #davanagerefoodtour

The family behind this non vegetarian eatery has a legacy of over half a century in the business. It is no wonder then that their 22-year-old Bharani Family Restaurant is Davanagere‚Äôs favourite destination especially for their mutton dishes made to traditional recipes featuring spice blends that are ground at home to this day. On a recent road trip from Hubli to Bengaluru, I stopped here to taste what was perhaps the most silken-textured lamb shank I have ever encountered, in addition to a very enjoyable khaima unde and spicy mutton dry. If you love mutton, plan a pitstop at this eatery; it‚Äôs a four or five kilometer detour from the highway, but well worth the effort getting there. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong; happy eating!

There can be no mention made of Dharwad without its most renowned export, the Dharwad Pedha. Not many know this, but the original version made at Babusingh‚Äôs Thakur Dharwad Pedha has a legacy that goes back over 150 years when a halwai (sweetmeat cook), Ramratan Singh migrated to Karnataka from Unnao near Lucknow to escape the plague. A new beginning was made in Dharwad where he would roam the markets with a tray of unique pedha to sell. It was only a matter of time before the taste of this roasted khoya creation caught the fancy of local palates, and like they say, the rest is history. Generations later, the Dharwad Pedha may be shipped across the globe, but is still handmade the old-fashioned way. I met with Karan Singh, sixth generation of the Babusingh‚Äôs Thakur family to learn more about the making of this iconic Dharwad mithai. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Exploring The Famous NIYAAZ BELGAUM BIRYANI! Chicken & Mutton Biryani Making Revealed!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KLU4cO5jG8,"#niyaazbiryani #belagavi #biryanimaking

belgaum‚Äôs most famous biryani, popular biryani restaurant in belgaum, niyaaz biryani belgaum, chicken biryani, mutton biryani, biryani making, belagavi, belgaum, belagavi biryani, niyaz belgaum biryani, niyaaz hotel belgaum biryani recipe, north karnataka food tour, belgaum food trail, belgaum food trail, belgaum food tour

How do biryanis become iconic? Well, most begin as tentative experiments and over a period of time endear themselves to the palate of the locals. So much so that the denizens of the place become vocal ambassadors for the biryani. And when it comes to Belagavi (Belgaum), the Niyaaz biryani is one such icon. Made in the kacchi akhni style, in which semi-cooked rice is layered over twice-marinated meat and cooked on dum, the Niyaaz biryani is subtle in its character, owing to a unique blend of spices, and the light fragrance of a short-grain locally grown rice that is used in combination with the more typical long grain basmati rice. What began as a family‚Äôs endeavour to create a unique biryani 30 years ago is now unarguably one of Belagavi‚Äôs most popular dishes. In this episode, I drive to Belgaum to meet co-owner, Niyaaz Abdussalam Saudagar, and explore in depth the making of both the chicken and mutton biryani, before proceeding to make a meal of these distinct Belagavi culinary signatures. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

THATTE IDLI Making & Tasting At Famous PAVITHRA HOTEL That Serves Thousands Of Idlis Every Day!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ikvcLHGX_U,"#tumkur #thatteidli #breakfast

It is a well-known fact that Pavithra Idli Hotel on NH 48 in Khyatasandra, just outside Tumakuru is famous for the thatte idli that they have been dishing out for 36 years now. But what I found most interesting is the meticulous attention to detail of the owner, Mr. Udaykumar, he actually refers to himself as the third owner, the first two, he says, are his customers and employees, in his well-planned and spacious kitchen, that is more than twice the size of the dining area, and could perhaps outrival most traditional kitchens on the highways of India. So confident is he about his back areas that he offers willing customers a tour without hesitation. It is no wonder then that the fare served here - the thatte idli, and also a scrumptious mini benne masala dosae that I wasn't expecting - has swarms of fans for whom a stop at Pavithra Idli is a must when on the road here.

Her Culinary Tribute To Her Late Husband!

In happier times, Bhagya Kulkarni‚Äôs conversations with her husband, noted television personality, Sanjeev Kulkarni, often revolved around bringing the street food of Hubballi, their hometown to Bengaluru. Their trips back home always included tasting forays to the eateries of Durgadbail and incessant recipe experimentations to perfect the robust masalas of Hubli street fare. When he fell ill, she set up a small business catering Uttara Karnataka meals out of their home in South Bengaluru to support the family. Unfortunately, he passed on, but Bhagya Kulkarni was determined to fulfil their dream, and thus was born Agraane Kitchen, a tiny shop that serves up the Durgadbail girmit, mirchi, avalakki usli, bun bonda, cut mirchi, etc., in addition to typical breakfast offerings and an austere but wholesome jowar rotti meal during lunch. I visit them on a rainy evening to savour the spicy, snacky street fare that I missed on my recent Hubli expedition, and to also support this enterprise that in a manner of speaking, is this brave lady‚Äôs culinary tribute to her late husband. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Visit SUVARNA MANDIR, Hubli's Oldest Restaurant For Tasty Misal, Madike Kalu & A Slice Of History!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOMRaj2oVzA,"#suvarnamandir #hubballi #oldestrestaurant

Established in 1940, Suvarna Mandir is perhaps Hubballi‚Äôs oldest restaurant, if not the oldest. Located amidst the hustle and bustle of Durgadbail market, it‚Äôs quite easy to miss the tiny doorway that opens into a courtyard setting in an ancient home from nearly a century ago. Looked after by third generation custodian Mr. Prakash Bhatt, when asked if he was the owner, replied that he was merely taking care of the space like his grandfather and father had before him, this eatery‚Äôs charming old school disposition extends to the fare that is served here. Misal, aloo bonda, poori bhaji, madke kaalu, etc. typical Hubli vegetarian breakfast snack fare, but one that is steeped in nostalgia for the locals, and reminiscent of old-fashioned goodness if you happen to be a visitor like me. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

In 2001, Mrs. Radha Bhat began a small eatery on the terrace of her home in Vidya Nagar, Hubballi to serve simple, fresh fare to students and working professionals in the neighbourhood who were yearning for home cooked meals. Slowly, but surely, the reputation of her Konkani seafood preparations, the fish sourced from the coastal town of Honnavar, began to travel, attracting not just those in the area but also visitors from far flung cities and towns in North Karnataka. Staffed only by women barring Mrs. Bhatt‚Äôs husband and son, Only Fish is a definite must-visit when in the city for its Konkani homestyle seafood fare served at extremely economical prices, as I discovered one rainy evening.

The fertile black soil of North Karnataka yields a rich bounty of vegetables and grain, and this delicious, fresh produce is best experienced in a traditional Jolada Rotti (jowar rotti) vegetarian meal at a khanavali (eating house) in the region. And the most popular jolada rotti oota seems to be the one served at Basaveshwar Khanavali, a string of vegetarian eateries in Dharwad, Hubballi and now, Bengaluru, that date back to 1963. We visited their main branch at Chennamma Circle in Hubballi, where we met the Ganachari family that is committed to serving sumptuous North Karnataka meals, and also discovered an interesting technique that makes their jolada rotti special. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating!

When Mr Vasudev Shetty moved from Mangalore to Hubli to begin Gurudatta Bhavan in 1958, he may not have imagined that in times to come his eatery would become one of the most popular food destinations in this bustling commercial hub. Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, Gurudatta Bhavan seems to draw in the denizens of Hubballi in numbers for its tasty fare that blends Mangalorean culinary style with influences of the land. I pop in for breakfast one morning to savour their sought-after puri kurma amongst other dishes, and also meet the family behind this 63-year-old restaurant.

Bengaluru‚Äôs Favourite KARNATAKA BHEL HOUSE Full Menu Tasting! Satisfying Chaat Cravings Since 1975!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9VzsmtgqNw,"#chaats #chaatmaking #bangalore

Every city has its distinctive chaat style, so does Bengaluru, including its very unique masala puri that is a hit with folks here. And a popular chaat destination is Karnataka Bhel House, which began as one of the earliest stores unlike food carts way back in 1975. Founded by Mr Prabhulinga Linga Dev who converted his provision store in Chamrajpet to a chaat shop on the advice of a friend who had just returned from plying the trade in Mumbai, KBH, as it is popularly known, may have branched out into spiffy operations across multiple outlets today. However, it is the consistency of the chaats here, we are told by its fans, thanks to the owning family‚Äôs focus on sourcing the best ingredients, for instance, the peas that go into the masala come from the US to ensure the same taste year-round, whilst all components and condiments that go into the chaat are produced in their central kitchen, that has made Karnataka Bhel House a popular chaat destination. I visit the flagship Chamrajpet store to take a close look at this bustling operation, and also savour everything on the menu! Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong.

If you are a meat lover, partaking of a traditional Savaji mutton meal is a must when in Hubli. Served in traditional homes of the Savaji community, almost hidden away in tiny bylanes of the city, the dishes are cooked by the women of the house and served exclusively by the menfolk. In this episode, we venture out to Nakod Savaji Khanavali in Durgadbail, and are rewarded with a delicious mutton meal, notwithstanding the seemingly brusque welcome and service ritual that only goes to reinforce the fact that it is all about the food here! Whilst at the eatery, we also take a peek into the kitchen to meet three generations of the Nakod family, including the women folk who cook the sheep-based fare to recipes that have been handed down through generations. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Exploring Davanagere‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld Famous‚Äù BENNE DOSAE At SRI GURU KOTTURESHWARA BUTTER DOSA HOTEL!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NDURx8iFqM,"#davanagere #bennedosa #srigurukottureshwara

Whilst no one knows exactly how many benne (butter) dosae eateries exist in Davanagere, some say over a hundred and fifty, also earning for this city, the moniker, ‚ÄòBenne Nagari‚Äô, most would agree that it is Sri Guru Kottureshwara Butter Dosa Hotel that seems to have put this scrumptious, fluffy, butter-laden, wood-fire roasted popular offering on the world map. Located strategically in a neighbourhood teeming with medical and engineering colleges, it was only a matter of time before the students for whom the dosae served here was daily sustenance, passed out and went across India and all over the globe evangelising the delicious virtues of the fare on offer at Sri Guru Kottureshwara. On a recent ‚Äògourmet on the road‚Äô expedition, I stopped by this iconic 37-year-old eatery to meet the family and explore what makes the Davanegere Benne Dosae  ‚Äúworld famous‚Äù! Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Hi folks, kicking off our North Karnataka series with this short and spicy episode that we filmed impromptu enroute to Hubli. Stopping at Davanagere, a city popularly known as Benne Nagari (the land of butter) to taste an iconic benne dosae, we were told that a visit here would be considered incomplete without tasting the crowd-pleasing evening snack of mirchi mandakki. Especially the one dished out at Subbanna Mirchi Masala, a tiny shop that has stood the test of time for over seven decades now. I catch up with the locals, and also the friendly owners, brothers, Subbanna and Srikanth, whose grandfather began the Subbanna mirchi mandakki tradition! Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Childhood friends, Koushik, Sachin and Sanketh, grew up in Kundapur, fascinated by the teeming variety of marine produce brought in by boats to the fishing ports of South Canara. The boys found themselves pursuing engineering degrees in Bengaluru, yet dreaming of seafood. Upon completing their studies, the engineers returned to Kundapur, built a food truck, roped in a village cook, before driving back to Bengaluru to launch their ‚ÄòMangalore in Bangalore‚Äô sea food enterprise. I visit them on a rainy evening for an interesting chat, and return mighty impressed with the marine spread on offer, the un-compromised rustic flavour of most of the dishes that I taste, and their commitment to offering fresh seafood at honest prices. If Dakshina Kannada coastal fare is your thing, or you are a seafood lover, do look up this young but delicious venture. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating.

Whilst we receive many messages, pictures, videos and comments on how an eatery is faring post a Gourmet On the Road episode, we rarely ever return immediately after the video is aired. However, we learnt that Chitradurga Mirchi Mandakki, an inspiring street food story, was overwhelmed with customers after our video, so I decided to venture out to see this response for myself and to also encourage the family behind this enterprise. I got to interact with many of our viewers, and along the way also met another inspiring street food vendor, Mrs. Muthulakshmi, who cajoled me into tasting her crunchy gobi manchuri. Hope you enjoy this off-the-cuff episode. Take care, stay safe and strong Happy eating!

Orphaned at a young age and in search of a livelihood, Huchappa migrated from his village to Bengaluru in 1950. He found employment with UP Brahmins who were dispensing paani poori from streetside carts. Having learnt the trade, he struck out on his own with a pushcart in Nagarathpet in 1950, infusing North Indian style chaats with local flavours. His son, Kumar continues the tradition under the shade of a temple peepal tree, which also gives his very popular chaat shop its name, Arali Mara, peepal tree in Kannada. In this chatpata episode, I taste most of the chaats on offer here. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Bengaluru loves its egg rice, a heavily indigenised variation of the fried rice fortified with an amalgam of punchy spices and fresh ingredients to cater to local palates. Whilst one will find a popular egg rice cart in almost every neighbourhood, there is perhaps none as popular as Snehajeevi Gowdara Adda Egg Rice, that thumps out enormous quantities to queues of patrons who wait patiently for the hot, spicy rice and other egg-y creations at this shop, ironically, located in the predominantly vegetarian neighbourhood of Malleshwaram. I dropped in one afternoon to take a closer look at this tasty creation and chat with the owner, Kumar Gowda, who began making egg rice in his pushcart 18 years ago when he was forced to give up the tender coconut trade. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular MYSORE PAK, DUMROTE | Original SRI VENKATESHWARA SWEETMEAT STALL 100 Years!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axF8sW3nhbo,"#mysorepak #dumrot #bangalore

bangalore‚Äôs most popular mysore pak, original sri venkateshwara sweetmeat stall, sweet shop in balepet, bangalore, mysore pak, dumrote, pure ghee sweets, traditional mithai, family run 

When it comes to the tuppada (ghee) Mysore Pak in Bengaluru, all roads lead to the original, Sri Venkateshwara Sweetmeat Stall in Balepet, an establishment with a legacy that spans over a century. After making a beginning in Chikkaballapur, the patriarch VA Venkatachalapathy Setty migrated to Bengaluru in 1952 to introduce the denizens of this city to his style of Mysore Pak, lush with ghee, and another equally popular invention, the Dumrote, a slow-baked crusty halwa made of ash gourd that takes the better part of a day to prepare. I catch up with the second, third and fourth generation of this iconic sweetmeat shop, and delve into the making of the Mysore Pak and Dumrote. Needless to say, I only leave after tasting these much sought-after Bengaluru delicacies. Hope you enjoy this unabashedly decadent mithai episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

It would be an understatement to say that current times have been especially tough for street food vendors, most who manage to earn barely enough for the day without much of a safety net to fall back upon. Against this backdrop, we were moved to hear of the struggles of a young engineering student who almost single handedly, with his mother, embarked upon a street cart venture to rescue his father and family from a crippling financial setback. And in the course of doing so, reconnected his father with a delicious North Karnataka snack tradition. In this street food episode, I stop by at Chitradurga Girmit Mandakki Centre to meet Ullas Basavaraju and his father, and also taste the Chitradurga mirchi in a scrumptiously delicious spicy avatar, some girmit mandakki masala and a rather intriguingly named ‚Äòoperation bajji‚Äô! Hope you enjoy this inspiring story; please spare a moment for eateries like these, and do your best to support them. Take care; stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

In a quiet bylane of Malleshwaram, sits a family-run enterprise that has been churning homemade ice creams the good old-fashioned way for nearly three decades using pure milk and milk fats, and devoid of any preservatives. It owes its origin to the late Mr. MN Sarathy, who after extensive training in ice cream making in Europe, set up this artisan ice cream parlour in his home nearly three decades ago. His family continues in his footsteps, strictly adhering to time-honoured recipes and methods, serving what is perhaps Bengaluru‚Äôs best old-fashioned ice cream.

"Burgers WIth A Tasty Twist! BOSS BURGERS | Piri Piri Chicken, Guacamole Bean, Juicy Mutton, Quinoa",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kMdVGh0Wb8,"#burgers #takeaway #bangalore

takeaway burgers, best burgers, bangalore, burger trail, guacamole black bean burger, quinoa vegetable burger, chicken piri piri burger, mutton burger, chicken tikka burger, bengaluru

I had never been a fan of burgers in takeaway mode. The buns usually suffer the ill effects of the journey, arriving limp and soggy, with the filling inadvertently reorganised depending on how bumpy the ride has been from the kitchen to your home. But we were blown away by the near pristine condition in which this extravagant order of burgers arrived, packed in sturdy cartons equipped with air vents to dissipate moisture. Packaging aside, the flavour and texture combinations too are the sort that work well to please most palates. As we discovered in this leisurely amble through some of Boss Burger‚Äôs most popular offerings, from a spicy chicken piri to desi chicken tikka, crunchy quinoa and root veggies to guacamole black bean and a loaded juicy mutton version that mimicked the smoky character of seekh kebab. Hope you enjoy this burger extravaganza; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular Masala Dosas! CTR vs. MTR vs. VIDYARTHI BHAVAN!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evJRnBqt64Q,"#ctr #mtr #vidyarthibhavan 

most popular masala dosas in bangalore, masala dosae, tiffin, ctr, mtr, mavalli tiffin rooms, lalbagh, vidyarthi bhavan, basavanagudi, bengaluru, bangalore

When it comes to the ubiquitous masala dosae here in Bengaluru, everyone has an opinion, actually many opinions, and clear favourites. Stuck at home during the recent lockdown, I couldn‚Äôt help but reminisce tasting three of Bengaluru‚Äôs most popular versions, and put together a special compilation for you, highlights of the CTR, MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Room, Lalbagh) and Vidyarthi Bhavan masala dosae from Gourmet On The Road.

Hope you enjoy this short and scrumptious bonus video; take care, stay safe and happy eating! 

CTR Benne Masala Dosa
This butter-drenched gold-hued dose is blessed with the perfect gentle crackle. On the palate, one tastes the lushness of the homemade butter that envelopes every bite of the dose, the palya and the chutney with its delicious veil. If you need one reason to visit CTR, this would be it.
Rs. 57 (usd 0.8)
10/10

MTR MASALA DOSA
The dosa here is iconic and never disappoints. Made with a blend of three rice varieties, including two red rice varieties that lend a toasty colour tone, the dose is crisp outside and soft within. The palya is seasoned just right. 
Rs. 90 (usd 1.3)
10

Vidyarthi Bhavan Masala Dosa
If you need one reason to visit Vidyarthji Bhavan, this would be it. A dose that‚Äôs crisp and lacey in parts, soft and fluffy in others, and hides within its single fold a creamy potato palya. The chutney is spicy and vivacious, a bold complement to the gentle flavours of the dose and palya.

Nagajyothi and her husband Manish Eswar gave up successful careers in the corporate world to set up Bangalore Tiffins, a modest eatery in Jakkur, North Bengaluru, where they serve traditional vegetarian tiffin fare made to their family recipes. Their offering is endearing in its simplicity, keeping in line with this young couple‚Äôs philosophy of serving ‚Äúfood that is pure and devoid of artificial additives, like soda, colours and taste enhancers.‚Äù Notwithstanding the current situation, and many setbacks along the way, including one where they lost all their cooks, thereby compelling Nagajyothi to take charge of the kitchen, Bangalore Tiffins holds promise in building for itself a solid reputation on the basis of its food, especially dishes like the pudi idli and masala dosa that I tasted on this breakfast outing.

Savour The Authentic Flavours Of Salem‚Äôs KONGUNADU Cuisine! MANGALA VILAS Bengaluru Takeaway,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO_a4pXXnww,"#salemcuisine #kongunadu #bangalore

salem‚Äôs oldest restaurant, non vegetarian, kongunadu cuisine, mangala vilas, egg labba, naatu kozhi leg roast, naatu kozhi pichi potta, mutton chukka fry, mutton chukka, kothu parotta, mutton biryani, koramangala, bengaluru

Over a year and a half ago, I visited Mangala Vilas, a 60plus year old eatery in Salem to explore the non vegetarian flavours of Konganadu, a unique cuisine, at the heart of which is a dark roasted masala of 15 or 16 spices. Needless to say, it was a meal quite interesting, especially having interacted with the skilled kitchen hands in Salem‚Äôs oldest non-vegetarian restaurant perhaps. The family behind Mangala Vilas have recently opened an outpost here in Namma Bengaluru, and I lost no time in ordering a big takeaway of their iconic dishes like the naatu kozhi leg roast, pichi potta fry, mutton chukka, kothu parotta, egg labba, among others. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong. Happy eating!

"This Young, Passion Enterprise Is Serving ‚ÄúThe Most Exciting‚Äù MAGGI In Town! THE BLUE WAGON KITCHEN",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elstn7sL9Cc,"#vegetarian #noodles #bangalore

popular eatery for noodles, sandwiches, milkshakes, coffee, cupcakes, habanero chilli cheese maggi, tomato, basil and mushroom maggi, cold coffee, nutella cupcake, support takeaway, the blue wagon kitchen, small business, inspiration story, young food entrepreneur, jayanagar, bengaluru

To many of us, a common food memory growing up was Maggi, the quintessential quick snack, and also a hunger saviour when one was cramming for exams late into the night! It had been a while since I tasted some, when I heard of this quaint six-seater eatery in Jayanagar, Bengaluru, that is redefining this fondly-remembered comfort food in the many varieties they dish out. From incorporating exotic fresh ingredients like basil and mushrooms to spicing it up with the stinging bite of fresh habanero pepper and mollycoddling it in cheese, this is the sort of Maggi that seems to have grown beyond its two-minute tagline! Much like the current palate of its patrons of yesteryear. 

Head to The Blue Wagon Kitchen or order in to savour the exciting avatars of your erstwhile two-minute sustenance! Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Not many know this interesting trivia about New Krishna Bhavan, Malleswaram, that until the recent lockdown this restaurant had not closed its doors even for a single day ever since they opened for business in 1954! Quite in contrast to the popularity of this vegetarian eatery. 
NKB, as it is fondly referred to by the locals who flock here not just for the satisfying tiffin and lunch fare, but also for tasty innovations like the green masala idli and the button idli, which apparently was made popular here first. In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, we catch the making of the intriguing and rather tasty green masala idli and also partake of a sumptuous breakfast at New Krishna Bhavan. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and happy eating.

ANAND Dum Biryani Vs. MANI Dum Biryani! Which Famous HOSKOTE Early Morning BIRYANI Should You Try?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSDX5VV5q4A,"#hoskote #biryani #bangalore

mani dum biryani, anand dum biryani, popular hoskote biryani shop, early morning biryani, popular biryani shop,, hosakote, hoskote, bangalore, bengaluru, mutton biryani, biryani trail, inspiring stories, karnataka

The Hoskote early morning biryani draws hundreds of faithful fans who wake up at an unearthly hour every Tuesday, Friday and Sunday to make the 40-km trek to queue up at biryani shops in this town just outside Bengaluru. 

However, for those not completely in the know, some of the most commonly asked questions with respect to this long-standing biryani tradition are: What‚Äôs the fuss about the Hoskote biryani? Which biryani should one try, should one try the Mani Biryani or the Anand Biryani? How different are these biryanis? Or are they similar? Which one is spicy, which one is not? What goes into the making of these hugely popular biryanis? Which one came first? And more‚Ä¶ 

In this special Gourmet On The Road episode, we revisit these biryanis and compare side by side Hoskote‚Äôs most popular early morning biryanis, undoubtedly, in an attempt to answer many of the questions posed. Hope you enjoy this one; take care, stay safe and happy eating! 

Anand Mutton Biryani 
The dominant flavours in this biryani are that of the fresh ingredients, the naati ginger, garlic, coriander,mint etc., followed by a veil of the aromatic spices. Every grain of rice is imbued with its flavours, and the meat is a combination of some soft, juicy pieces and some on the bone, that calls for a bit of effort to get to every bit of it, some fat included. The spicing is gentle and warm. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1) 
9/10

Mutton Biryani
The only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that‚Äôs made in Mani‚Äôs home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one‚Äôs mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)

In this takeaway lunch, we ordered a simple but sumptuous jowar rotti meal that came close to quelling our North Karnataka craving, but most importantly included a delicious bonus in the seekarne, a spicy, slightly tangy ripe mango dish that is a must-try before the season ends!

"Bengaluru‚Äôs SOFTEST IDLIS Takeaway| BRAHMINS‚Äô COFFEE BAR | Idli, Vada, Chowchow Bath | Rerun Episode",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xDVw8KWl3s,"#brahminscoffeebar #idlivada #bangalore

support local eateries, takeaway south indian breakfast, brahmins‚Äô coffee bar, idli, vada, chutney, kesari bath, khara bath, shankarapura, bangalore, bengaluru

When it comes to soft, melt-in-the mouth idlis, all roads lead to Brahmins‚Äô Coffee Bar idlis, or at least it did until the current situation. I visit this modest South Bengaluru eatery that‚Äôs big on its reputation to see how they are coping with life post covid, and take back a parcel of their entire menu consisting of all of four items only! Are the idlis still as soft? Well, you‚Äôll have to watch this one to find out. Stay safe and happy eating!

Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please support local eateries.

Takeaway Dish Review

Idli
A coarse-grained porous idli that allows for the chutney to seep in, you can taste a slight tartness from the fermentation. With the spicy ghatti chutney, that is made of hurukadale, roasted Bengal gram, coconut and  the idli takes on a bold, flavourful avatar. Pour the ‚Äòtelu‚Äô or ‚Äòflowy‚Äô mint-coconut chutney over the idli to make for a bite that melts in the mouth.
Rs. 34 (usd 0.45) for 2 idlis 
 
Uddina Vade
It‚Äôs a tough act for the vade to follow the idli in takeaway mode, given that the vade is best savoured hot and crispy. However, a saving grace here is the vade is studded with curry leaves, green chillies, peppercorns, fresh coconut, thereby making for a flavourful bite. Soak up the past-warm vade with the chutney to relish the warming heat from the green chillies in the chutney. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) per vade

Khara Bath
BCB‚Äôs khara bath is a flavourful one, embellished with curry leaves, toasted lentils, mustard seeds, grated coconut, coriander, tasty enough to be savoured sans the chutney. But if you like it spicy, go ahead and introduce it to the zesty gatti chutney. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 

Kesari Bath
End your takeaway tiffin with the kesari bath! There‚Äôs tonnes of ghee that goes into this sweet semolina and vermicelli concoction and you can taste it in its lush richness. The flavours draw from the tangy fruitiness of the pineapple and the warming cloves. The plum raisins add a sugary pop when you bite into one. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 

Note: I haven‚Äôt rated these as I feel it would be unfair to rate South Indian breakfast items in a takeaway format. Since this is a rerun episode, prices of the dishes may have changed since.

Brahmins‚Äô Coffee Bar is open only in the mornings from 6am to 1030am presently.

A couple of months ago, I was introduced to Mast Marathi, where a Maharashtrian lady entrepreneur, Swati, aided by her Kannadiga husband, Shekar, is serving up an extensive vegetarian menu comprising the flavours of her land. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and strong.

"CHAAT, North Indian veg Thali, Mithai Takeaway From BHARTIYA JALPAN 75-Year Legacy | Rerun Episode",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMdtUhjCkRA,"#bhartiyajalpan #vegetarian #supportlocal

support local eateries, takeaway, bhartiya jalpan, chats, chaats, vegetarian thali, mithai, namkeen, samosa, chole bhature, dahi bhalla, aloo tikki, north indian, bangalore, bengaluru

To quell a chaat and north indian veg food craving, we take away from the Bengaluru outpost of Bhartiya Jalpan, a 75-year-old mithai and namkeen house from Guwahati, Assam. Now whilst takeaways aren‚Äôt the best way to savour desi chaats, we found the flavours spot on if you‚Äôre looking to savour some chatpata desi fare. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating.

Note: This episode was first released in June 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.

Samosa
The dark spiced stuffing makes this a chatpata samosa, the pastry is flakey and still retains its crunch despite being cold. The date chutney is warming and spicy.
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) per samosa 
8.5/10

Chole Bhature
A popular snack at BJ, the bhatura loses its puffy vigour in takeaway mode, but is still redeemed by the deep flavours of the chole (chickpeas). Definitely a dish that needs to be snacked on when at the eatery as opposed to takeaway.
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 

Raj Kachori
The kachori had become soggy by the time we turned our attention to this yoghurt laden chaat, but the crisp sev and moth beans still offer crunch. The yoghurt is sweet, savoury and sour. 
Rs. 129 (usd 1.7) 

Dahi Bhalla
A dumpling (bhalla) made of rice flour and urad dal, topped with spiced yoghurt, this is the perfect takeaway chaat as the bhalla has soaked up the spicing from the yoghurt and the chutneys. 
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2) 
9/10

Aloo Tikki
A potato patty stuffed with a spice mix and shallow fried on a griddle until crisp, and served with peas gravy. Smash the patty along with the peas to help the chutneys seep into the potato.
Rs. 129 (usd 1.7) 

Bhartiya Jalpan Shaahi Thaali
A tray laden with paneer makhani, aloo mutter, daal, boondi raita, jeera rice, chapatis, a sweet, pickle and papad, this meal option is a sumptuous one. I found the chapatis soft, the paneer soft and creamy, the vegetables cooked the manner they should be and the dal a nourishing accompaniment to the jeera rice. 
Rs. 269 (usd 3.6) 
8/10

Malai Chamcham
The chamcham just dissolves in one‚Äôs mouth leaving behind a veil of aromatic sweetness. Highly recommended.
Rs. 38 (usd 0.5) 
9/10

Rabri
Sweetened milk braised slowly over hours and topped with thick cream and nuts, what‚Äôs there not to like!
Rs. 81 (usd 1.1) 
8.5/10

Note: I haven‚Äôt rated some of the dishes as I feel it would be unfair to rate them in a takeaway format. Since this is a rerun episode, prices of the dishes may have changed since.

"Iconic MAVALLI TIFFIN ROOM Veg Lunch Evolves For Takeaway! Rava Idli, Masala Dosa |  Rerun Episode",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvwU1HzEmVc,"#mtr #vegetarian #supportlocal

support local eateries, takeaway, mtr, mavalli tiffin rooms, lalbagh, vegetarian lunch, thaali, rava idli, masala dosa, hema malini maiya, bangalore, bengaluru

Step into Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, the city‚Äôs oldest eatery, In this throwback episode to see how they have evolved their popular 21-item traditional lunch to a more convenient and packaging-friendly 9-dish mini-meal. 

From revamped, sanitised processes to consolidated menus, this century-old institution is revamping and reworking processes to meet the needs of the current situation. But then, that shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise, because after all, they do have a tradition of innovating through adversities in the past, as illustrated in the invention of the rava idli during the rice famine of the 40s, or the seed for MTR packaged foods that was sown during the 1975-77 emergency. 

Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.

Mini Meals
No longer the enormous spread that would be a delicious gateway to a post-lunch slumber, the mini meals is compact in its post-covid avatar. But that doesnt get in the way of making for a satisfying lunch, puri, saagu, rice, rasam, palya, mosaru anna, poppadom, uppinakayi and payasam, the mini meal has all that you need to savour a taste of Mavalli Tiffin Room. 
Rs. 162 (usd 2.1) 
8/10

Masala Dose
Although packed in a foil-lined box, the masala dose is missing its crunch in takeaway mode, understandably, as opposed to when savoured at the restaurant. You can heat it on a tava with a dollop of ghee to make some amends, and the flavours are trademark MTR, the sprightly chutney smeared inside the dosa and the flavourful, bright aloogadde palya. The chutney is rich in coconut and green chilli spice. All in all, makes for a delicious takeaway dose, once you get past the expectation of eating something crisp.   
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2)

Rava Idli
A dish born of a crisis, the rava idli is said to have been invented in the kitchens of Mavalli Tiffin Rooms, when there was a shortage of rice during the famine of the 40s. This is a flavourful rava idli that is rich in yoghurt, embellished with coriander, mint, coconut and topped with toasted cashew, and does spectacularly well as a takeaway. The aloogadde sagu serves well to moisten the idli with its savoury character. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)

support local eateries, takeaway, nagarjuna, koramangala, vegetarian lunch, banana leaf meal, chilly chicken, sholay kebab, andhra restaurant, traditional eatery, koramangala, bangalore, bengaluru

In this throwback episode, we visit Nagarjuna, a popular Andhra eatery, to order and take away their popular vegetarian carrier meals, post temperature checks, hand sanitisation and electronic payment, time-appropriate practices that we will need to get used to. The food, packed in tamper proof containers and relished in the comfort of our home,  though remains as comforting as one remembers it from the good old days. Hope you enjoy our this one, take care, stay safe and strong.

Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.


Vegetarian Carrier Meals
This weighty meal can feed an army, well, at least 3 to 4 hungry diners. The food is staple Nagarjuna fare with creamy lentils pappu, nourishing sambar, tangy tomato rasam, teh customary koora or vegetable with all the mandatory accoutrements - pappulu podi, curd chillies, payasam, papad, pickle and more served with a humongous bucket of rice. 
Rs. 420 (usd 5.5) 
8/10

Chicken Sholay Kebab
One of Nagarjuna‚Äôs most popular boneless chicken appetisers is embellished with loads of curry leaves. The flavours seem a bit sedate in takeaway mode when the dish is eaten around 30 minutes or so after it‚Äôs prepared, as compared to the spicy, aggressive bite one encountered when eating this at the restaurant. A tasty bite nonetheless. 
Rs. 305 (usd 4)
7/10

Chilly Chicken
The chilli, spelt with a ‚Äòy‚Äô as opposed to an ‚Äòi‚Äô on the menu is as unique as the dish in itself. Not to be confused with the popular Sino-Indian version, this is Andhra‚Äôs ode to its love affair with the chilli. The chicken is moist and juicy, soaking up a gravy made of copious amounts of green chillies, a dish that will have you begging for more punishment if that‚Äôs your thing! Definitely not for the faint-hearted though!
Rs. 285 (usd 3.8)

Tasting VIDYARTHI BHAVAN Bengaluru's Iconic MASALA DOSA In Lockdown Takeaway | Rerun Episode,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhLJ8U5J-Sg,"#supportlocal #vidyarthibhavan #masala dosa

support local eateries, takeaway, vidyarthi bhavan, basavangudi, south bangalore, traditional vegetarian tiffin in bangalore, masala dosa, dose, idli vada, chutney, old world restaurant, traditional eatery, bangalore, bengaluru

In its 78 years of existence, Vidyarthi Bhavan has always served its iconic masala dose within its premises, keeping it strictly outside the purview of delivery services. However the current scenario calls for an entirely new approach in food service, and in keeping with this, this revered South Bengaluru eatery has embraced takeaway as a new way of life, at least for the foreseeable future. I visit Vidyarthi Bhavan to document this change from the past and see for myself how its management is taking all steps necessary to ensure continuity of its delicious culinary traditions in as safe a manner as possible. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!
Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support Bengaluru eateries with takeaway orders in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.


Masala Dosa
The masala dose is now folded twice as opposed to the VB classic one fold, an allowance that the eatery has made for the dose to be rolled into an aluminium foil in order to retain its temperature when savoured at home. The crispy crackle of the dose is now replaced by a whisper of a crunch, but the buttery flavours are still spot on. The dose oozes ghee, and the aloogadde palya is mildly seasoned and creamy. It helps to crispen the dose a bit on the pan just before eating. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7) 

Idli
VB‚Äôs idlis are the grainy sort, perfect for ladling over chutney and piping hot sambar, before breaking it down to a delicious, spicy mash. If they‚Äôre too cold by the time they get to you, steam for a couple of minutes.
Rs. 26 (usd 0.3)

The vade definitely suffers the most casualty when consumed in a takeaway format. Gone is its crisp crunch, that would yield to a porous bite. The only way to redeem the vada is to dunk it into a bowl of piping hot sambar and savour it with a dollop of spicy chutney.
Rs. 26 (usd 0.3) 

Khara Bath
The kharabath travels extremely well, given its moist texture. This tasty dish is studded with onions, fried lentils, coconut flakes and curry leaves, making for a playful medley of flavours and textures.
Rs. 26 (usd 0.3) 

Kesari Bath
End your meal with this luscious semolina preparation, the flavour of the pineapple and cloves is quite pronounced. The dish is mellow in its sweetness, save for the pop of extra sweetness when you bite into a toasted raisin.
Rs. 26 (usd 0.3) 

Note: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available. Prices may have changed since when this episode was originally published a year ago.

Inspiring NOON‚ÄôS BIRYANI | This Family Biryani Shop Went From Tough Times To Customers Across India!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ZpBaydPK4,"#supportlocaleateries #smallbusiness #bangalore

noon‚Äôs biryani, popular biryani shop now sells in 18 cities, support eateries, small business, restaurants, takeaway, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, hsr layout, bangalore, bengaluru

When I first met Mr. & Mrs. Mohammed a few months ago to film an episode of Gourmet On The Road, they were barely getting by. The pandemic had quite literally taken the wind out of their enterprise, a tiny 3-table eatery in a nook of South Bengaluru where Mr. Mohammed and his son would sell the biryani made by his wife at home. However, the sincerity with which this affectionate couple shared the making of the biryani in our video seems to have won for Noon‚Äôs Biryani legions of fans resulting in a new lease of life for this neighbourhood shop that now has customers across India, with requests from overseas patrons too for their special biryani spice blend. I caught up with them for a quick chat a few weeks ago when I popped into their store to take away some biryani, and also left with a healthy dollop of inspiration based on what the family had managed to achieve notwithstanding the current challenges of life. I hope you enjoy this impromptu inspiring vlog, take care, stay safe and happy eating.

if possible, please spare a thought for the many neighbourhood restaurants and eateries that have given us abundant culinary pleasures and now depend on our support to make it through these gloomy days, one small takeaway order at a time.

TIMINGS: lunch - 1pm to 4pm; dinner - 630pm to 10pm
Note: Closed on Mondays; they make the mutton biryani only on weekends. Whilst you will get a biryani for lunch, dinners are usually takeaways only. Do call them before you visit to ensure you get our biryani. Although you can have a quick biryani meal here, it is best to take away. Order ahead to ensure you get what you want.

"Popular Biryani Takeaway | MEGHANA FOODS | Vegetable, Aloo, Chicken, Mutton | Rerun Episode",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZM26KrPqdU,"#lockdown #biryani #supportlocaleateries

support local eateries, takeaway meal, meghana foods, biryani, vegetable biryani, hyderabadi chicken biryani, boneless chicken biryani, aloo biryani, mutton biryani, koramangala, bangalore, bengaluru

Hi folks, hope you are doing well. In this throwback takeaway biryani review, we visited Meghana Foods, a establishment that seems to have a formidable following for its biryanis that are mostly made in the Hyderabadi style with loads of masala. Purists may balk at the eatery‚Äôs top seller, a boneless chicken biryani that to me seemed like a culinary intersection of Sino-Indian and Hyderabadi fare! Love it or hate it, you certainly can‚Äôt ignore Meghana Foods!

And to allay consumer fears in a covid world, they seem to be following many of the practices - temperature checks, hand sanitation, sealed takeaway packs, etc. - that will have to be the norm when it comes to eating out. Hope you enjoy this one, take care and stay safe.

Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support local eateries.

Special Veg Biryani
A biryani that panders to a vegetarian‚Äôs biryani craving. The rice is flavourful, and the side of tossed vegetables draws clever inspiration from a mirchi ka salan in its flavours. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3) 
8/10

Aloo Dum Biryani
The potatoes are fried to a delicious brown and have absorbed the flavourful character of the fried onions and the spices. With the mildly spiced biryani rice, it makes for a tasty combination.
Rs. 214 (usd 2.8) 
7.5/10

Chicken Biryani
A biryani that is made in the traditional Hyderabadi style with loads of masala, this is the biryani to try here. The meat is juicy, moist and flavourful, cooked perfectly to the bone.
Rs. 242 (usd 3.2) 
8.5/10

Chicken Boneless Biryani
Tender morsels of boneless meat, tossed in a spicy batter are served as an accompaniment to fluffy grains of biryani rice. Though a dish that is far removed from a traditional Hyderabadi biryani, it still commands legions of fans, I suspect partly because the spicy morsels of meat and generous portion of rice served makes it ideal for sharing. 
Rs. 248 (usd 3.3) 
8/10

Mutton Biryani
The meat was a tad chewy and dry and lacking succulence, the rice though had a nice depth of flavour. Not a biryani that I would order again. 
Rs. 301 (usd 4) 
7/10

Note: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available. Prices may have changed since when this episode was originally published a year ago.

I want to share with you measures that I take when I am ordering food, from a taste, safety, and peace of mind perspective. Hope you find this useful, I have also placed some of my research reference links below. Stay safe and happy eating!

Links to references I have looked up to determine if eating outside food is safe:

Specifically, coronaviruses are thermolabile, which means that they are susceptible to normal cooking temperatures (70¬∞C). Therefore, as a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.

Food containers and packaging. There's no evidence of anyone contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 after touching food containers and food packaging. Many restaurants are now offering no-contact takeout and delivery to lessen the risk of transmission.

Still, if you're concerned, it's reasonable to follow general food safety guidelines. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water after handling takeout containers, and then transfer food to a clean dish using clean utensils. Wash your hands again before eating. After disposing of containers, clean and disinfect any surfaces that had takeout containers on them.

This 80-Year-Old Has Seen Famines But Never This! Support NEW MODERN HOTEL Takeaway | Rerun Episode,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN98jgYZ0uE,"#supportlocalbusiness #newmodernhotel #vegetarian 

support local eateries, takeaway meal, new modern hotel, lockdown, new modern hotel, basavangudi, south bangalore, traditional vegetarian food in bangalore, south canara food, traditional vegetarian food, thatte idli, set dosa, khara bath, kesari bath, rice rasam, rice sambar, anna saaru, lunch, old world restaurant, traditional eatery, bangalore, bengaluru

Mr Padmanabha Adiga, has seen famines, plagues, political unrest and other disruptions in the 60 years he has helmed this old Bengaluru institution, New Modern Hotel, but says the current situation is something else altogether! An optimist though, he and his sons prepare to do what it takes to tide this South Canara vegetarian eatery through. Inspiration aside, I also take away a simple but nourishing anna-saaru meal in addition to some of their popular tiffins and sweets. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care, stay safe and happy eating.
Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support the eatery and others like this establishment that need help in the current situation. Please do support local eateries.

Set Dose
There‚Äôs a hint of tart sweetness in these soft, fluffy dose that are perfectly suited for takeaway. With the nourishing sambar, vegetable saagu and chutney, it makes for a wholesome light meal. 
Rs. 48 (usd 0.6) 

Thatte Idli
Soft and porous, the thatte idli breaks under its own weight. The sambar, pleasing to the palate with its sweet acidity is perfectly suited to impregnate the idli with its mildly spicy fervour. 
Rs. 29 (usd 0.4) 

Khara Bath
As you place the khara bath in your mouth, the savoury aroma of the onion is what you taste first, followed by the moist crunch of the tomato and the grainy bite of fresh coconut. Spice things up with the chutney. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 

Kesari Bath
Redolent in the flavour of cloves, this isn't a kesari bath that‚Äôs dripping in ghee. Which makes for a tasty indulgence minus the guilt.
Rs. 27 (usd 0.4) 

Anna Sambar
A sambar rich in lentils and grated coconut, made well, the vegetable, ladies finger, still has its crunch intact. 
Rs. 43 (usd 0.6) 

Anna Saaru
The tomato plays a dual role in this pleasing South Canara tilli saaru, more popularly known as tomato rasama here in Bengaluru. The tomatoes are the foundation of this tart broth, and also offer a fruity crunch in the diced tomato that is perhaps added when the rasam is near cooked. 
Rs. 43 (usd 0.6) 

Mysore Pak
Rich in ghee, the fresh mysore pak crumbles under its own weight. When you place it in the mouth, it dissolves into a lush, buttery pool of deliciousness.
Rs. 18 (usd ) per piece 

Jehangir
Crisp, crunch and moist, this well-made old-fashioned mithai is a popular sweet at NMH.
Rs. 18 (usd ) per piece 

Note: Due to the current uncertain situation, please call the eatery to ascertain the timings and what is available. Prices may have changed since when this episode was originally published a year ago.

Support Mr. & Mrs. Iyer's 60-Yr-Old IYER MESS | Takeaway A Tasty Veg BANANA LEAF Meal! Rerun Episode,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15FIsLSePnw,"#vegetarian #takeaway #bangalore

support local eateries, iyer mess, takeaway meal, iyer meal, pure vegetarian meal, carrier meal, vegetarian lunch, banana leaf meal, sambar, rice, kootu, veg meals, bangalore, malleshwaram, bengaluru

Mr Venkatesh and Mrs Kamala Iyer serve up Tamil and Kerala Brahmin traditions in their tiny eatery, Iyer Mess, established by the former‚Äôs father in 1959. The food is simple, yet delicious, cooked by Mrs Iyer and honestly priced at Rs. 80 for a sumptuous vegetarian banana leaf meal. 
As I catch up with the Iyers when I get this takeaway meal, I can't help but feel sorry for this elderly couple who are trying hard to grasp the realities of business in the new normal. From 200 meals a day, they are now reduced to under 30, and despite the financial hardships that they endure, they have held onto their staff, lodging and boarding them at home to ensure they are safe. Spare a moment for establishments like Iyer Mess even as you watch this episode. Take care and stay safe.

Vegetarian Meal
A simple meal, the Iyer Mess banana leaf is laden with everything that one needs for tasty sustenance. With a menu that changes everyday, the spread - rice, sambar, rasam, kootu, poriyal, thayir, pickle and papad - is nourishing, and of the sort you would relish at a Tamil home blessed with a good cook. And offers great value.
Rs. 80 (usd 0.9) Rs. 100 takeaway

Note: This episode was first released in May 2020 and is being rerun to support the eatery and others like this that need help.

It is a rather difficult time for eateries and restaurants everywhere. Barely had they somehow scraped through last year, the ones that managed to survive that is, the current scenario yet again threatens hundreds and thousands of livelihoods that depend on this sector. In this ‚Äòsupport restaurants‚Äô vlog, I return to The Lighthouse Restaurant to meet lady entrepreneur, Prathiksha Nayak and learn how they are coping, and to also taste some delicious dishes that I missed out on when I was here last. Whilst we must all stay safe and take adequate precautions for ourselves and our loved ones, if possible, please spare a thought for the many restaurants and eateries that have given us abundant culinary pleasures and now depend on our support to make it through these gloomy days, one small takeaway order at a time. Take good care of yourself and stay safe; this too shall pass. God bless.

Cooling Down With Bengaluru‚Äôs Latest TENDER COCONUT SHAKE Trend! ‚ÄòOriginal' YELNEER KATTE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVsygFbaAJA,"#coconutshake #yelneerkatte #bangalore

trending coconut dessert, popular coconut shake, tender coconut shake, ice cream, summer cooler, dessert, milkshake, smoothies, healthy coolers, yelneer katte, basavangudi, bangalore, katte special, ice cream, small business

With the mercury rising, Bengaluru‚Äôs denizens seem to be turning to the yelneer or tender coconut water shake, a dessert trend that seems to be the flavour of the season. I ventured out to Yelneer Katte, supposedly the store that began this rage in the city to decipher for myself what the fuss was all about. Hope you enjoy this short and icy-cool episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Katte Special
Coconut flesh crushed with coconut milk, cream and nuts, this is the one to have if like me you prefer tasting the ‚Äòcoconutty‚Äô character. The nuts and raisins also add to the nutty flavor and thick texture of this shake, the pomegranate seeds provide a fruity pop and the swirl of condensed milk a rich, creamy finishing touch. The sweetness is just right.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Yelneer Mango Shake With Vanilla Ice Cream
A loaded shake, coconut flesh ground with coconut water and fresh mango, topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, nuts, fresh mango and some condensed milk. A tasty milkshake, but one cannot taste much of the coconut as it is overpowered by the ice cream, chocolate sauce and a copious amount of sugar. 
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)

"TARAYI COASTAL CUISINE | This Family Eatery Is A Labour Of Love! Fish Thali, Ghee Roast, Crab Masala",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtCxQoYYRHQ,"#seafood #mangalorean #bengaluru

family eatery, st thomas town, east bangalore, new restaurant, coastal cuisine, fish thali, fish fry, pomfret, mackerel, fish fry, prawn ghee roast, crab masala, chicken curry, small business

Tarayi, a tiny three-table eatery in St. Thomas Town, East Bengaluru, was born of homemaker Freeda Ananth‚Äôs desire to share the culinary legacy of her late mother and to set up a small business of her own. So, with the support of her husband, Vijay Ananth, this soft-spoken lady ventured out as a restaurateur just a couple of months ago, and in a relatively short span of time has managed to make an impression on the neighbourhood with her rendition of Mangalorean-Kundapur fare laced with a touch of Kerala influence. I visited Tarayi to taste their limited but tasty homestyle offerings, and to also help share the word on this family enterprise that‚Äôs a true labour of love. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Prawn Ghee Roast
This ghee roast masala exudes a slight sour twang followed by the warmth of the chilli and spices. The prawns are cooked just right, delicately ‚Äòspringy‚Äô on the bite, swaddled in the grainy textured masala with the lushness of ghee.  
Rs. 270 (usd 3.6)
9/10

Black Pomfret Fry 
The masala is napped rather lightly on the fish, allowing for the pomfret to shine in its fresh flavours. The skin is cooked to a perfect crisp.
Rs. 250 (usd 3.3)
8.5/10

Seer Fry
Rs. 280 (usd 3.7)
8/10

Crab Masala
Loved the aromatic masala, onions, tomatoes and spices, soaked up by the plump, meaty sea crab. The sweet crab meat contrasts beautifully with the savoury notes of the masala. If you love crab, this is certainly a must-order when here.
Rs. 240 (usd 3.2)
10/10

Fish Thali
A satisfying thali, complete with modest portions of mackerel curry and fry, in addition to sambar, rasam, vegetables, boiled rice‚Ä¶ perfect if you‚Äôre looking to savour Mangalorean fare on a budget.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
8/10

Kheema Ball Curry
A pleasing curry, I found the meat ball a tad pasty and giving up the texture of the flour used to bind the mince together.
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6) for half portion
7/10

Chicken Curry
A homestyle curry, thin in its consistency but rich in the flavour of the masala. Goes well with the neer dosae. 
7.5/10

Helmed by a relatively new food entrepreneur, Ramamurthy, who was left with no option but to move to Mysuru and begin this mobile eatery to support his family after losing his life‚Äôs savings, the bamboo biryani is a result of his culinary passion and kitchen experiments. This version of the biryani that is steamed in bamboo for a couple of hours, isn‚Äôt what one may traditionally expect, but certainly makes for an interesting dish to taste! Check it out if you find yourself in Mysuru. Hope you enjoy this short and sweet episode, take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Mutton Biryani 
The sort of biryani that tumbles onto the plate when semi-cooked meat masala is placed in the bottom of a bamboo cylinder, topped with aromatic rice and egg,  and steamed for a couple of hours. The thick masala clinging to the meat serves to moisten the rice and the meat, some pieces soft and yet others that warrant a bit of a chew. The bamboo lends its aroma to the preparation.

GANGA‚ÄôS MUDDE MANE | Homely Gowda Cuisine| This Brave Couple Makes A Fresh Start Despite Challenges!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH_PB5_dxEE,"#traditional #gowdafood #bangalore

new gowda cuisine eatery, vegetarian thali, non veg meal, nalli fry, ragi mudde, kheema unde curry, mutton peas pulav, kaal soup, boti gojju, chicken tava roast, small business

A sudden loss of occupation forced Hemanth Kumar to deploy his life savings and rustle up an eatery to support his family. Seeing her husband struggle, Nalini gave up her teaching job to support him in this enterprise that aspires to serve homestyle Gowda food. I visited Ganga‚Äôs Mudde Mane one afternoon to meet and motivate the brave couple, and along the way tasted an elaborate spread. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Kaal Soup 
An aromatic soup that serves well to whet your palate. The tomato conveys a pulpy texture laden with the meaty broth.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
8/10

Brain Fry
Flavoured with the lightest touch of spice, pepper and curry leaves, the ‚Äòbheja‚Äô is cooked to perfection and melts in its rich buttery lushness when placed in the mouth. If you love the brain, a must-order here!
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)
10/10

Chicken Tava Roast
Marinated in a green chilli, ginger garlic paste, it is the freshness of the mint that shines through the masala. I found the chicken a tad chewy. 
Rs. 190 (usd 2.6)
7.5/10

Boti Kal Goju 
A thick preparation enlivened with the starchiness of raw banana and nourishment of lentils, the boti is cooked through well. 
Rs. 170 (usd 2.3)
8/10

Mutton Kheema Ball Curry
The kheema unde is rich in its meatiness and is complemented by the green chilli and coriander. Eat this hot to prevent the gram flour, used to bind the meat, from making its presence felt on the palate.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.5)
7.5/10

Chicken Kheema Goju 
Tiny cubes of chicken tossed in a tasty masala. What makes this dish interesting are flecks of yam that bring its earthy flavours. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)
7/10

Nalli Fry 
A weighty lamb shank, some of the meat has a bit of a bite, but as you work your way to the core of the nalli, the meat is tender. There is depth of flavour from the spices and the pepper. 
Rs. 380 (usd 5.2) for two large pieces, the price for this varies by weight. 
9/10

Veg Meals 
A vegetarian will enjoy this simple but homely assemblage with as much gusto as a non vegetarian. From the scrumptious dill fritters to the comforting sprouts saaru and rasam, each dish bears the mark of a talented home cook, in this case, Nalini Hemant Kumar. I would happily order this with a non-vegetarian side.
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
8/10

Mutton Peas Pulav 
Made three days a week, this is a pulao that is moist, gentle and aromatic. The aroma of the whole spices is what one tastes on the palate alongside the faint warmth of green chillies whose heat has been toned down by some coconut milk that goes into the pulao just before it is placed on dum. The meat in the pulao is soft and has a bit of fat ribboned through it, the peas are endearing in their soft bite.

"Tasty, Rustic Breakfast At NANI HOTEL, Vijayapura | Popular Ghee MASALA DOSA, Bele Bhath And More...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEhwzgH9IFY,"#traditional #villagebreakfast #ruralbangalore

popular breakfast spot 50 kilometres from bangalore, village eatery, bengaluru, rural bengaluru, nani hotel, masala dosa, dose, idli, vada, bisi bele bhath, chitranna, tomato rice, masala vade, kesari bath, coffee

Given its modest beginnings as a village eatery in a hut six or seven decades ago in Vijayapura, S. Narayan Rao, the late founder of Nani Hotel may have found it hard to fathom its current immense following that draws Bangaloreans to drive 50 kilometres for breakfast here. Having discovered its tiffin delights on a motorcycle ride a couple of months ago, I returned to savour breakfast, catch up with the owning family and patrons to find out what‚Äôs special here, including their much-loved Nani Hotel Masala Dosa. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Tuppa Masala Dosa
The ghee masala dosa is the top draw with patrons here. Smeared with a spicy chutney as it roasts, the dosa is ladled with a dollop of potato palya and a top-up lashing of ghee to ensure the tuppa is what customers taste in plenty. The result is a golden-brown dosae that is slightly thick and biscuity in its crunch and lush with ghee, cradling within its fold a creamy, flavourful palya. The chutney makes for a spicy accompaniment.

"Tasting A Delicious, Traditional Kerala Meal | KAPPA CHAKKA KANDHARI | Ramassery Idli, Appam & Stew",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-a4U095NgQ,"#traditional #keralacuisine #bangalore

best kerala restaurant, bangalore, bengaluru, koramangala, traditional, malayali food, kappa chakka kandhari, appam and stew, karimeen, pearlspot fry, kappa fish curry, pazham kanji, pidi kozhi curry, duck roast, kappa vada, tapioca, ramassery idli, appam and stew, puttu, mutton coconut fry, meen pollichathu, tender coconut pudding, kandhari ice cream, payasam, chef regi mathew

The folks behind Kappa Chakka Kandhari restaurant take their food rather seriously, after all their menu is a showcase of Malayali fare based on their collective memories of growing up in Kerala. And spearheading this unique ‚Äònostalgic‚Äô culinary initiative is Chef Regi Mathew, who has spent more than a decade extensively touring his home state, exploring recipes and connecting with cooks across homes, community kitchens, and even toddy shops. The resulting food is a labour of love, with ingredients sourced from micro-regions in Kerala to match the provenance of the dish, for instance the rice for the fabled Ramassery Idli comes from Palakkad, the home of the idli, the karimeen (pearl spot fish) from Vaikom, Kottayam, and so on‚Ä¶ This fastidious approach to sourcing also seems to extend to the kitchen hands at KCK too, who hail from traditional kitchens and homes in ‚ÄòGod‚Äôs own country‚Äô. In this episode, I partake of a lavish lunch that spans across a dozen preparations, made possible by their innovative menu approach that allows for diners to savour a string of delicacies in the course of a meal. Hope you enjoy this one, take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Note:
The set menus at Kappa Chakka Kandhari are priced upwards of Rs. 475 (usd 6.5) and in addition to a tasting of seven preparations, include a beverage and dessert too. Additional add-ons (limited servings), kappa vada, koorka fry, ramassery idli with chicken curry, are priced at Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) per dish.  

Rajayogi Meal
A set menu that‚Äôs fit for a king, this smorgasbord of a dozen dishes is sheer indulgence! Begin with juicy prawns in a coconut-kokum masala that is steamed in a petite banana leaf pouch, spicy ‚Äòtouchings‚Äô of needle fish, the plumpest soft shell crabs, and a delicately flavoured pearl spot fish draped in a robust, toddy shop masala, amongst other delicacies that include a peppery chicken peralan and a slow-cooked mutton coconut fry. After an interlude of a sweet, sour and spicy, pineapple-nendram relish, the main courses troop out - pidi, tiny rice dumplings steeped in coconut milk and served with a flavourful simple chicken curry, a velvety mutton stew and appam combo, and a prawn puttu biryani that hits the spot. For dessert, there‚Äôs much to choose from, we tried the chilli-pricking kandhari ice cream and the luscious tender-coconut cloud pudding.
Rs. 1475 (usd 20.3)       
9/10 (overall) The pearl spot fry, mutton fry, soft shell crab, pineapple nendram relish, mutton fry, appam and stew  - 10/10

Ramassery Idli With Varutharacha Chicken Curry & Sambar

Ayakora Nellikai Masala Fry

"Tasting North Bengaluru‚Äôs Best Pizza At SIDDY‚ÄôS PIZZA | Veg Margherita, Chicken, Sicilian Pepperoni",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYKbOWpPEeo,"#pizza #yelahanka #bangalore

best pizzas, north bangalore, bengaluru, siddys pizza, pizza recipe, pizza, pizzeria, margherita, smoked chicken, garlic bread, pepperoni, handmade pizzas, italian, authentic sicilian style pizzas, siddy, siddhanth sawkar, yelahanka, bangalore

When Siddhanth Sawkar was forced to close his caf√© and home catering-turned-food truck brand, Spitfire Barbeque, owing to the pandemic, he spent a couple of months mulling his next move, making pizzas. Not just a generic version as dished out by fast food chains! Instead, he dug deep into his experience as a culinary student in Southern Italy, to open a pizzeria serving Sicilian style pizzas in his erstwhile North Bengaluru caf√© in Yelahanka New Town. Siddy‚Äôs Pizza, as I discovered during a leisurely visit, is a one-man passion enterprise, where Siddy, as Siddhanth is known, does everything from taking the order to putting together the pizzas to serving customers who quite often chat with him as the cheese-laden flavourful pies bake in the oven. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Garlic Butter Bread
Pillowy soft and gushing with garlic-infused buttery flavour; the butter is molten as the bread comes out of the oven! Changes your perspective of what simple garlic bread can be! The cheddar cheese dip makes for an indulgent accompaniment.
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
9/10

Classic Margherita & Cheese - Large
Its dough fermented for a few hours, the pizza is firm and toasty, drooping at the edge, burdened under the weight of a generous topping of cheese. The sharp, spicy notes of the homemade tomato sauce, salsa semplice, is softened by the mozzarella. 
Rs. 350 (usd 4.8)
8/10

Smoked Chicken & Cheese - Large
The juicy personality of the chunky, smoked chicken franks take over the palate the moment you bite into this cracker of a pizza, followed then by the slightly, sweet crunch of the onions. The cheese and tomato sauce play second fiddle to the meat and onions. If you love smoked chicken, this pie is a must-have!
Rs. 420 (usd 5.8)
10/10

Classic Pepperoni & Cheese - Large
Lush in virgin olive oil, this is a classic Sicilian style pizza, its ‚Äòbready‚Äô texture quite similar to a focaccia. There‚Äôs plenty of mozzarella that sits atop the pizza, followed by the spicy sauce and onions. But it is the fat-laden savoury fervour of the pepperoni that is the hero of this pizza! This pizza is also the sort that would make for a great midnight snack when left over in the refrigerator.
Rs. 650 (usd 9)

With a culinary lineage that goes back to Hotel Manju, supposedly the first table-service restaurant in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh in the sixties, Sashidhar Reddy and his wife, Vijayalakshmi, moved to Bengaluru from Nellore little over a year ago to open Vijay Kitchen, to serve dishes made to traditional family recipes. I visited this modest eatery set in the ground floor of their home in the suburb of Brookefield, where I not only savoured a delicious Andhra Bhojanam but also caught the making of an iconic Nellore Chepala Pulusu, a sour and spicy fish curry.

Served on a banana leaf tray, the rice meals is a simple but satisfying affair that consists of two vegetables, one dry and the other moist, a sambar, rasam and a nourishingly tasty pappu to keep company with the anam (steamed rice) and flavoured rice. There is also a sweet to round off the meal.
Rs. 99 (usd 1.4)
8/10 

Chepala Pulusu (Sour and Spicy Fish Curry)
Made by his wife, Vijayalakshmi, to a recipe that goes back to Sasidhar Reddy‚Äôs grandmother, the Chepala Pulusu is a must-try here. A sour and spicy affair, the fish curry is made the evening before, thereby allowing for the fish to soak up the vivacious character of the tamarind, raw mangoes, chilli powder and the secret fenugreek spice blend. 
Rs. 180 (usd 2.5)
10/10

Mamdikaya Royyalu (Mango Prawns)
A tangy preparation that juxtaposes fresh flavours of shrimp to the tart fervour of raw mangoes. Taste it with the annam (rice) to tone down some of its tangy flavours.
Rs. 250 (usd 3.4)
9/10

Chepala Fry (Fish Fry)
Chinese pomfret or lake pomfret naped in a pleasant masala; the skin is fried to a crisp.
Rs. 150 (usd 1.4)
7/10
 
Royyalu Avakkai
A spicy, homemade prawn pickle that makes for a great combination with steaming hot rice.
8/10
 
Mutton Pepper Ghee Roast 
The meat is moist and juicy, coated with coarsely ground pepper and tossed in the buttery lushness of ghee. The meat is cooked twice, first a roasted fry with masala, and then tossed around in hot ghee. 
Rs. 250 (usd 3.4)
9/10

RR Chilli Chicken
This dish should come with a ‚Äòchilli hotness‚Äô warning! Not for the faint-hearted, there is little else in this dish other than the chicken and tonnes of green chilli. The result is a unique taste that‚Äôs fiery at first but also the sort that endears itself once you get past the ‚Äòsuffering‚Äô! If you like it toned down, tell them so and they will toss it in some ghee.
Rs. 150 (usd 1.4)
8/10

Chicken Fry Biryani
A dish that was introduced as a means to consume leftover biryani rice, topped with chicken fry, the chicken fry biryani today is more popular than the Nellore biryani here. One can taste the warming flavours of the biryani spices in the kushka, the rice, that makes for a great combination with the robust tomato-onion rich masala of the chicken fry. 
Rs. 180 (usd 2.5)

SRI CHIKKAVEERANNA SWEETS | This 72-Year-Old Village Shop Serves PURE GHEE MITHAI & KHAARA Items!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TartLlvy3j0,"#mysorepak #badamhalwa #vijayapura

popular sweet shop in rural bangalore, vijayapura, bengaluru, sri chikkaveeranna sweets, mysore pak, badam halwa, ghee jilebi, pure ghee sweets, traditional mithai, family run, tuppa, ghee red rice avalakki

In 1948, Chikkaveeranna opened a sweetmeat stall in Vijayapura, then a sleep hamlet located fifty kilometres from Bengaluru. The stall would travel from village fair to village fair selling mithai and khaara made of pure country ghee. 72 years on, village ghee may no longer be easily available, but Suresh Chikkananjundappa, his grandson, tends to the traditions of his ancestors in the ghee sweets and savouries that he personally prepares with his family and dedicated workers. Their mysore pak is hugely popular, made to a special technique where the gram flour is lightly roasted with some ghee, before finding its way into the paaka or sugar mixture. However, the tuppa jilebi, with the batter fermented overnight in clay pots, the rich badam halwa made with homemade khoa, and a seriously addictive red rice avalakki mixture, all made with pure ghee, are also must-haves when at this tiny sweet shop. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Tuppa Jilebi
Made of a batter that is fermented overnight in a clay pot, and fried in pure ghee, the result is a white jilebi that crackles with a sticky bite and unburdens its ghee-laden sweetness with just a tinge of sourness. 
Rs. 440 (usd 6) per kilo 
9/10 

Tuppa Avalakki
Red rice puffed to a crisp in a bath of boiling ghee, comes together with ghee-roasted cashewnuts, curry leaves, Bengal gram and generous sprinkling of spices to make a seriously addictive khaara or mixture.  
Rs. 560 (usd 7.7) per kilo 
9/10 

Mysore Pak
Soft and crumbly, lush with ghee, this is the sort of Mysore Pak that dissolves on the palate with the light lilt of cardamom, when fresh. You can taste the weight of the gram flour, especially in the tiny clumps that have held on to the ghee as the gram flour is lightly roasted before it finds its way into the sugar syrup or paaka. The hero ingredient in this mithai though is the ghee that makes it Sri Chikkaveerana‚Äôs most popular mithai for over seven decades.
Rs. 560 (usd 7.7) per kilo 
10/10 

Bene Murukku
One of the few items here that is made in oil, the murukku though crunchy and flavourful with cumin and carom seeds and the nuttiness of sesame, feels a bit spartan when tasted in the company of the other heavyweights here.
Rs. 280 (usd 3.8) per kilo 
8/10 

Badam Halwa
Garnished with chironji seeds and slivers of pistachio and almonds, the halwa is rich with the reduced milk solid, ghee and the grainy bite of coarsely ground almonds. Although, the Mysore Pak is traditionally more popular here, the badam halwa comes a close second. 
Rs. 640 (usd 8.7) per kilo

ROYAL MESS | This Couple Serves Memorable Hyderabadi Mughlai Food At Their Mysuru Home Eatery!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bzzd_VCS9k,"#restaurantathome #mysore #mughlai

home eatery in mysore, royal mess, mughlai, hyderabadi cuisine, mutton kheema, mutton masala, butter chicken, korma, biryani, kheer, sameena khanum, homestyle food in mysore

When Sameena Khanum‚Äôs husband retired from his job overseas, she decided to do something on her own to support the family. Her love for cooking led her to open a tiny eatery at home with two tables only, catering initially to college students yearning for home-cooked meals. Entirely self-taught, Mrs. Khanum serves up a repertoire of Hyderabadi-Mughlai dishes, assisted by her husband and children. A meal here is not just about delicious sustenance but also about the warming hospitality with which one is welcomed and served, as I discovered when I dropped into Royal Mess late one evening. Hope you enjoy this episode; take care, stay safe and happy eating!

Mutton Kheema
The mutton kheema is coarse and grainy, cooked with meat on the bone, that results in a deep-flavoured, warming dish. The sort that makes it a must-try here.
Rs. 350 (usd 4.8) for a large portion.
9/10

Mutton Masala
Flavoured with the gentle sweet flavours of fresh tomato and the savouriness of onions, the masala is tasty. The meat is soft, there‚Äôs a bit of fat that one needs to work through. One could request for slightly less fat, makes for an enjoyable dish. 
Rs. 400 (usd 5.5) for a large portion.
8.5/10

Chilli Chicken
A homestyle chilli chicken that is spiced with green chillies and red chilli powder and plenty of garlic. There are onions and capsicum too. A chilli chicken that isn‚Äôt as spicy as one would expect it to be. 
Rs. 220 (usd 3) for a large portion.
7.5/10

Butter Chicken
A rich cashew nut gravy that had a tad too much dried fenugreek garnish for my liking, the meat, a bit of a bite. 
Rs. 220 (usd 3) for a large portion.
7/10

Chicken Biryani
Made with long-grained basmati rice, the flavourful masala is an amalgam of fried onions, tomatoes, yoghurt and Mrs. Khanum‚Äôs home-blended spice mix. The biryani had cooled down a bit, rendering the rice slightly dry and the meat a fibrous bite. Ensure that you arrive at Royal Mess when the biryani is freshly made to savour this preparation.  
Rs. 175 (usd 2.4)

"Traditional Breakfast At New SHIVALLI | Kotte Kadubu, Rajamudi Dosa, Kuchalakki Ganji, Ragi Ambli",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPvwj112zhc,"#mysorehighway #vegetarian #breakfast

popular restaurant on mysore highway, shivalli restaurant, mtr shivalli, mudagere, channapatna, bangalore mysore road, kotte kadubu, rajamudi rice, neer dosa, dose, kuchalakki, boiled rice, finger millet, ragi ambli, healthy food, healthy breakfast, highway breakfast, wheelchair accessible

One of the earliest eateries on the Bengaluru - Mysuru route, Shivalli has recently emerged after an extensive renovation that imparts this 20-year-old popular highway destination a breezy, contemporary vibe that comes as a breath of fresh air in current times. It is heartening to note though that the food remains as traditional as ever, in fact, with some ‚Äònew‚Äô additions seeking to convey to diners the wholesome flavours of the good old days. On a recent drive to Mysuru, I stopped by for a delicious breakfast of nourishing porridge, kuchalakki (boiled rice) ganji, tenginkai haalu (coconut milk) ganji, ragi (finger millet) ambli, and also tasted a scrumptious neer dosa made of the very special Rajamudi rice, and their much-favoured kotte kadubu. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating! 

Kotte Kadubu
Soft and slightly grainy, the kadubu is a much-sought-after breakfast delicacy here; savour it with their flavourful south canara sambar and spicy ‚Äòkai‚Äô chutney
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
8/10

Thenginkai Ganji
Rice soaked in coconut milk and topped with a lashing of ghee. Pleasant in its aroma, flavour and texture, this is a porridge to savour if you‚Äôd like something light post a heavy meal the evening before. The cucumber served alongside provides an element of crunch. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
7/10

Kuchalakki Ganji
Boiled rice, sourced from Kundapur, cooked simply with salt and served with a drizzle of hot ghee. Comforting in its nourishing flavours, the rice retains its form and is soft to the bite, having lent some of its starchy heft to the broth. The hand pounded chutney of green chillies, fresh coconut and rock salt provides a spicy edge to the ganji. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
8/10

Ragi Ambli
The cumin is dominant in its flavour in this earthy but sumptuous broth of finger millets. There is also a delicate tinge of green chilli heat and pepper. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
7/10

Neer Dosa
The Rajamudi rice lends a brownish tinge to the dose, and also a crusty crunch. The dose is roasted with generous lashings of ghee, ensure you ask for your dose to be kadak. The flavours are quite unlike a traditional neer dose; although enjoyable on its own when hot, the bela kai, jaggery with fresh grated coconut makes for a delicious companion. If you like a touch of spice, there is the chutney too.

"Lunch At LAKSHMAN MESS | Mysore‚Äôs Famous Naati (Local) Non Veg Eatery |Mutton Pulav, Curries & Fries",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRZpvLCPzE,"#mysuru #lakshmanmess #muttonpulav

popular eatery in mysuru, must-try, non vegetarian, naati style cuisine, local, affordable, mutton pulav, mutton curry, mutton fry, chicken kebab, khaima unde, inspiring story, mysore 

Armed with recipes gleaned from his mother, Lakshman quit his job at a spice shop, to begin a small pushcart operation to serve the non-vegetarian delicacies of his home. Bit by bit, the reputation of his food grew, and after 20 years of eking out a living on the streets, Lakshman was finally able to move into a tiny shop where customers could finally dine away from the bustle of the street. A few years later, the landlord wanted his space back, and faced with no option, he tore down his home to build a permanent space for Lakshman Mess. A eatery that has all of Mysuru thronging here for their honestly-priced limited menu that includes a delicately flavoured pulav, homestyle meaty preparations cooked by Lakshman and his son, Satya, with masalas ground at home. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care, stay safe and happy eating! 

Chicken Kebab
Mild in its flavours, the batter has a flavourful crunch that could have enlivened the taste of the kebab had it seeped all the way into the meat.
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2)
7/10

Mutton Chops
Chunks of meat that have a bit of bite, cooked in a delicious masala that is dominant in the flavour notes of coriander and mint, and the aroma of the special spice blend. The pepper coconut milk adds a layer of creamy warmth. This is the sort of dish that makes for an appropriate side dish to taste with the demure pulav. 
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4)
9/10

Mutton Pulav
Delicately flavoured and moist, the Lakshman Mess pulav employs a combination of the long-grained basmati and short-grained rice varieties. You taste the faint edge of the green chili alongside the mint and coriander, the whole spices too aren‚Äôt the sort that dominate the palate. The meat is tender and juicy. I loved the pulav as is for its demure character, but if you like yours spicy, savour it with the meaty curries.
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)
9/10

Kaima
Minced mutton balls simmered in a spicy gravy, spicy when compared to the mutton curry and pulav. 
Rs. 50/ 100 (usd 0.7/ 1.4) for half/ full portion
8/10

Mutton Fry
Curry leaves meet soy sauce in this mutton stir-fry, a dish created for the benefit of locals who wanted something different, I found this a slightly discordant fit on the Lakshman mess menu.

Must-Try Mysore‚Äôs Very Popular KUKKARAHALLI LAKE Breakfast Tradition | DEEPU GAADI & MYSURU KAAPI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyv6DnmttXg,"#mysuru #breakfast #coffee

popular breakfast spot in mysuru, food in mysore, mysore food trail, traditional, south indian tiffin, dosa, dose, set dosa, thatte idli, filter coffee, kukkarahalli lake, mysore 

Every city has its popular morning traditions, Mysuru too has its share of them. A delicious one though seems to be that of going for a long walk around Kukkarahalli lake followed by a steaming, hot breakfast at a food rickshaw, Upahara Darshini, popularly known as Deepu Gaadi. The popular draw here is the set masala, smaller than your usual dosa, perhaps to let its fans indulge in more than one of these scrumptious beauties. On a recent dash into Mysuru, I took time out to experience half of this popular tradition, no points for guessing which half, followed by a delicious cup of filter kaapi. Hope you enjoy this breezy watch. Take care, stay safe and happy eating!
 
Breakfast At Upahara Darshini (Deepu Gaadi)
I paid Rs. 70 (usd 1) for a single thatte idli with a vade, and a plate of set masala dose. The thatte idli is soft, a bit pasty, but goes well with the chutney. The set masala dosa though is the dish to try here. The dose is well roasted, crisp and translucent in the centre, revealing flecks of a spicy red chutney smeared within. 
8/10 overall 

Filter Coffee At Mysuru Kaapi
The coffee is thick, strong and just the sort of beverage to wash down an indulgent ghee-laden breakfast.

Tasting Karnataka‚Äôs Famous BANNUR MUTTON In Bannur | Bandur Sheep | Lunch At BANNUR MILITARY HOTEL,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrIaqAE347o,"#bannurmutton #biryani #karnataka

bannur mutton explained, bandur sheep, bandur village, malavalli, mandya, bannur, mysore, mutton biryani, mutton fry, mutton kheema, bannur military hotel, ramaswamy hotel, mutton meal

The Bannur mutton, Karnataka‚Äôs most prized mutton, isn‚Äôt actually from Bannur. It is the meat of an indigenous variety of sheep that hails from Bandur, a village located between Malavalli and Bannur near Mysuru. Prized for its juicy tender meat, the sheep was traditionally sold in village shanties in Bannur, ergo the acquired moniker, Bannur. I drove to Bannur to learn more about this sheep and also catch a mutton meal at a family eatery, Bannur Ramaswami Military Hotel, that showcases this very special meat in its homestyle preparations. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating! 

Nati Koli Kurma
The chicken has a bit of a chew, a character of the free range chicken, there‚Äôs a bit of skin too that adds to the flavourful character of the homestyle curry, which is the sort that goes well with the ragi mudde.
Rs. 110 (usd 1.5) 
8/10

Kaima Sambar
Dumplings of rough-ground mutton simmered in a curry, the meat has a springy bite to it. There is also some dil that lends its aroma to the meat balls. 
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) 
8.5/10

Mutton Fry
The fat of the Bannur mutton is ribonned through the meat that is deep in its slightly salty, savoury flavours. The curry isn't too spicy, and is quite happy playing second fiddle to the flavour of the meat.
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1) 
8.5/10

Bannur Mutton Biryani
You can nose the kasoori methi (dried fenugreek) in the aroma of the biryani, there‚Äôs the warming heat of the red chillies and spices that you can taste on the palate, a touch of tang from the tomatoes‚Ä¶ the kolam rice is tasty all in itself, also having absorbed the character of the meat. The meat is soft and moist, deep pink in its colour and veined with fat. This is a biryani you should eat hot, do not allow it to cool down for the fat tends to congeal.

Serving Delicious Wood Fire Idlis For 50 Years | Original KOTE IDLI KANAKAPURA| 4 Idlis Rs. 10 Only!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ocUJGYBFzo,"#idlichutney #kanakapura #karnataka

After completing the 10th grade, a young lad decided to help his father in their village idli shop in Kanakapura, 60 kilometres from Bengaluru. Half a century on, Mr. Ramchandra has remained steadfast to his father‚Äôs culinary tradition, steaming fragrant idlis over a wood fire. A one-man army, he procures the ingredients, prepares the wood to fuel the decades-old stove, soaks the rice and lentils, grinds and carefully ferments the batter, before rising at 4am each morning to make a spicy chutney, and steam over 3000 idlis, 500 in a batch, that run out before noon! Working with the energy and enthusiasm that is hard to imagine in a modern-day sextagenarian, Ramchandra swears by the philosophy of ‚Äúcheap and best‚Äù, in his words, selling four piping-hot idlis for only Rs. 10, or Rs. 2.50 a piece! The quality and appeal of the soft, fluffy idlis are such that patrons don't mind a two-hour drive just to breakfast at this old-fashioned Kote Idli Mane. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!

Idlis
The idlis are soft and porous, yielding with a slightly pasty texture in its weight. The size of the idlis are such that you can happily savour about four to six without feeling its burden. The spicy, roasted gram and red chilli chutney makes for a delicious accompaniment to the fragrant idlis. 
Rs. 10 (usd 0.1) for four idlis

Making Of Famous Village Style HALLI JONNE BIRIYANI | From Pushcart To Popular Biryani Eatery!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHiG_RzPA8I,"#biryani #jonnebiryani #bangalore

popular jonne biryani shop, donne biryani, bengaluru biryani, jayanagar, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, mutton chops, chilli chicken, chicken curry, leg piece, mutton kheema, inspiring story, jayanagar, bangalore

As the oldest son in his family of modest means, Ningaraju was compelled to look for work as a student. His fondness for food and his ability to recall the flavour of dishes from local eateries led him to set up a pushcart on the outskirts of Bengaluru, serving a self-taught village-style biryani. In the beginning, ‚Äúthings were difficult, sometimes humiliating and marked by periods of self-doubt‚Äù, recalls Raju, as he is popularly known. Giving up though wasn‚Äôt an option, driven also by the necessity to provide for his family. Slowly, the popularity of his mild-flavoured biryani served in cups of dried banana leaves, jonne, grew, and so did the scale of his enterprise. Today, this resilient entrepreneur‚Äôs Halli Jonne Biryani occupies prime real estate in Jayanagar, South Bengaluru, and is frequented by over 500 customers on any given day. I catch up with Raju as he makes the biryani before sitting down to a tasting of most of the dishes on the limited menu here. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!

Kaal Soup
The soup is peppery, infused with the freshness of coriander.
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)

Khaima Goju
The mutton mince is coarse, there‚Äôs a rustic rawness to the masala that is smoothed by the fluffy texture of the idli.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8)

Chicken Leg Piece
Cooked soft and tender to the bone, you can taste the pungency of ginger garlic that‚Äôs softened by the acidity of tomatoes.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8)
8/10

Mutton Fry
Some of the meat is soft and tender, with a bit of fat, others have a bit of a bite. You can taste the coriander and the pointed heat of green chillies in the masala. The flavours are mild but satisfying.
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
9/10

Mutton Liver Fry
The peas make for a nice touch in this gentle gravy; some of the liver pieces though were a bit tough.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8)
7.5/10

Chilli Chicken
An unusual chilli chicken, you can taste the fresh flavours of the green chilli as opposed to its heat. The mildest chilli chicken I have ever tasted.
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)
8.5/10

Chicken Kabab
The kabab is scrumptious and flavourful, the chicken is moist and seasoned well, but doesn‚Äôt hold on to the spicing of the batter.
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)
7/10

Chicken Biryani
The seeraga samba rice is stained pastel yellow with a tinge of green, reminding one that this biryani hasn‚Äôt borne the brunt of a masala overload. Not the sort of biryani that one will smell from a mile away, the flavours though are the sort that reveal to the palate the ingredients that have gone into its making. You can taste the tingling heat of the green chilli, the freshness of the coriander and mint, the veil of fragrance from the spices register. A biryani that also brings to the fore the flavour of the seeraga samba rice. If you like it spicy, you may need to taste it with the curries that are served alongside the biryani. 
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
8.5/10

Mutton Biryani
The mutton has rounded off the flavours of biryani, as opposed to the chicken version. The meat is tender and moist, its fat laden flavours the sort that compels one to draw a bit of the meat in every scoop of the rice. These biryanis are perhaps the lightest donne biryanis one has tasted.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.5)

Great food should be physically accessible to all food lovers, shouldn‚Äôt it? But the sad truth is, it isn‚Äôt! I recently received a message from one of our viewers speaking from experience of the challenges that those in wheelchairs face, trying to manoeuvre from their vehicle on the street onto the sidewalk, the premises, and then to the eatery. To help the community of wheelchair users, can you try and do one simple thing. 

When you put up a restaurant post on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or any other social media, include the hashtag #wheelchairaccessible in your post in case the restaurant is.

Let‚Äôs try and help build a resource of #wheelchairaccessible eateries for those who rely on wheelchairs for mobility. Do share, repost and help spread the word. üôèüôè

When it comes to food personalities in Karnataka, Sihi Kahi Chandru is perhaps one name that everyone knows. An acclaimed actor, director and producer, he has endeared himself in the hearts of every Kannadiga for his prolific food shows on television. Over the last couple of years that I have been producing Gourmet On The Road, I have received numerous comments requesting for a collab with him, so it was a pleasant surprise and an honour to receive a call from him inviting me as a guest to Bombat Bhojana, his show on Star Suvarna. In this vlog, I share a behind the scenes peek on my participation in the show and a quick conversation with the legend himself.

Hope you enjoy the vlog, and do tune in to the episode of Bombat Bhojana on Star Suvarna on 30th January at 12pm IST.

Exploring Bengaluru‚Äôs Love For The GOBI MANCHURIAN AT RAVI GOBI | Vegetarian Street Food,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKK75xAlN0E,"#gobimanchurian #ravigobi #banashankari

vegetarian, popular gobi manchurian, street food, auto, manchurian sauce, gobi, gobi dry, fried rice, cauliflower manchurian, cabbage manchurian, potato manchurian, baby corn manchurian, mushroom manchurian, banashankari, bangalore

Armed with the recipe for a crowd-pleasing manchurian sauce that he learnt from a chinese cook, 16 year-old Ravi set out with an auto 21 years ago to serve gobi manchurian in the South Bengaluru neighbourhood of Banashankari. Two decades on, Ravi Gobi seems to rule the heart of gobi manchurian lovers in the city, as evidenced by the number of customers who throng his vegetarian sidewalk eatery each evening. I caught up with Ravi and some of his happy patrons over an extended manchurian tasting session recently, where I savoured not only his popular cauliflower and cabbage versions, but also an equally appetising, babycorn, mushroom and potato variation too. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!

Each dish on the Ravi Gobi menu is prepared fresh to order, every plate served piping hot and therefore necessitating a wait of 10 to 15 minutes. The gobi or potato/ mushroom/ baby corn, fried fresh, dressed in a chilli-salt spice mix to make the dry version, or tossed in a savoury manchurian sauce that has the fresh zing of coriander, green chillies, ginger, garlic and onions.
Babycorn Fry & Manchurian - 9/10
Cauliflower Manchurian - 8.5/10
Overall food rating - 8/10
Full plate - Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
Half plate - Rs. 35 (usd 0.5)

This Man ‚ÄòInvented‚Äô The WHITE PAANI PURI! Tasting BANGARPET CHAAT At Ramesh Chit Chat In Bangarapet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD1UNQafyto,"#chaat #bangarapet #karnataka

bangarpet chaat, chaat innovation, white paani, vegetarian, white paani puri, pani puri, masala puri, sev puri, bangarpet tikki, pot gulkand salad, pizza paani puri, street food, pani puri, bangarapet, kolar district, kolar gold fields, kgf, karnataka

Son of R. Panduranga Setty, who is said to have begun the Bangarpet Chaat tradition in 1974 in Bangarapet, named so (Bangar = gold, pete = town) for its importance as a town that connected the erstwhile Kolar gold fields to Bengaluru, 80 kilometres away, young Ramesh, wasn‚Äôt happy just continuing with the family legacy. A desire to create something new led to the invention of the ‚Äòwhite paani‚Äô, a clear liquid that though as innocuous-looking as water, packs a potent, spicy punch. And thus began the tradition of the Bangarpet Paani Puri, that has spawned a few hundred namesakes in Karnataka. Ramesh however continues to operate out of his tiny shop in a bylane in Bangarapet, serving customers personally and experimenting constantly to add to his spicy, tangy repertoire. I spend an evening with him, tasting his wares, and return impressed with his childlike enthusiasm that doesn‚Äôt seem to have waned in the least despite being in the business for nearly four decades, his latest creation, a pizza inspired paani puri! Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

White Paani Puri
A simple assemblage of green peas, onions, carrots and coriander, stuffed in a semolina and flour puri, topped with the potent ‚Äòwhite paani‚Äô. The spiciness of paani though is toned down by the creaminess of the peas and the crunch of the onions. A simple, clean flavoured paani puri that allows one to appreciate every component singularly, as well as in its completeness. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)
8.5/10

Special Dahi Puri
Embellished with rose petals, this chaat is a riot of flavours and textures. The crispiness of the chaat components and the spice of the masala play second fiddle to the creamy, sweet richness of the yoghurt that is fortified with Horlicks, milk powder and sugar. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
10/10

Floating Paani Puri
The floating paani puri is a spicy affair, the spicy white paani goes into the puri and also floats the puri. The moist crispness of the puri is endearing as is the crunch of the spiced peanuts and the sev, despite the fresh crunch of the onion, cucumber and tomato, there is no getting away from the chilli heat of the sea of white paani. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
9.5/10

Tikki Masala Bangarpet
A take on the Bengaluru masala puri, this is puri topped with spicy chutney, sweet chutney, peas, garam masala, squeeze of lime, onions, carrots, coriander, sev and puffed rice. It has all the components that you would expect to find in a chaat without being overdressed! 
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

Special Sev Puri
The flat papdi base for this chaat is fried in ghee which gives it a rich, ‚Äòbiscuity‚Äô bite embellished with the nuttiness of sesame seeds. You can taste the edge of garlic in the chutney that the fresh ingredients are tossed in. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
9/10

Bhelpuri
A typical bhel but with the addition of the peas gravy that goes into every plat of chaat here, I found this rendered the puffed rice soggy and that didn‚Äôt quite work for me.
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)
7/10

Pizza Paani Puri
I doff my hat to Ramesh on his latest attempt to innovate and bring a foreign flavour to the bylanes of Bangarapet. However, with regards to its taste and appeal, some may fancy it, yet others question its existence. 
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4)

Spiced Amla
Rs. 30

Pot Gulkand Salad

"Blockbuster KGF - KAVERI GODAVARI FOODS | Tasty Curries, Dosa, Parotta Cooked In Wood Pressed Oil!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHnDVmGuXCU,"#foodtruck #tamilnadufood #bangalore

traditional tamil nadu, salem style, non-vegetarian, street fare, food truck, kalakki, mutton kari dosa, nati chicken, mutton chops, brain fry, pepper fry, podi dosa, east bengaluru, bengaluru 

When Prabhu, an automobile engineer with a major car company chose to pursue his entrepreneurial calling in food, a food truck didn't come across as a surprise to his father who encouraged him to pursue his dreams. After getting his hands on a Tempo Traveller, he drove it to Pune to fabricate a food truck that would serve up the meaty cuisine of his Tamil heritage with a smattering of influences from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka as well. Back in Bengaluru, this culinary enterprise on wheels, Kaveri Godavari Foods, is slowly but surely gaining popularity in the neighbourhood it is parked in. Adding to its appeal is the fact that all dishes here are prepared at Prabhu‚Äôs home and cooked in wood-pressed oils extracted in the family‚Äôs oil mill. I drive 20 kilometres to East Bengaluru to catch up with this passionate engineer and experience the streetfood vibe here whilst savouring a bunch of tasty preparations - egg kothu parotta, kalakki podi dosa, mutton parotta, chops, nati chicken, brain fry and more. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!
 
Mutton Brain Fry
Tava-fried with eggs in an aromatic, homemade masala, this is the dish to taste if you love brain meat; it quite simply melts in the mouth. The eggs also help make more of the dish that is perfect, mopped up with some parotta.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
9/10

Kuzhambu Kalakki
A Salem egg staple, egg cooked skilfully such that it encloses within its folds a gooey, spicy egg mixture. Traditionally, this is eaten at the end of a non-vegetarian meal in Salem.
Rs. 15 (usd 0.2)
7.5/10

Mutton Kari Dosa
A fluffy dosa topped with coarse mutton mince, eggs and served with a spicy curry, this is the sort that makes for a satisfying one-dish meal or a big late-night snack.
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
7.5/10

Mutton Chops
Goat chops cooked in a gravy rich in the flavour of dark-roasted spices, this is a dish that will bring me back to KGF. The meat is the sort that peels away from the bone in a juicy, peppery bite. Order a plain dosa to soak up the curry.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
10/10

Podi Dosa
One can smell the nutty aroma of the peanut oil that this dose has been roasted in. The dosa is smeared with an Andhra podi whilst being fried to a near crisp. A dose that goes ‚Äòcrunch‚Äô from the first bite to the last, with a slightly tangy edge.
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
9/10

Nati Chicken Pepper Fry
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
7.5/10

"SWAD - N - SWAD | This RAJASTHANI Couple Is Serving Delicious, HOME-COOKED Traditions Of Their Land!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsjXUFz-dA,"#homecooked #rajasthanifood #bangalore

rajasthani food, vegetarian, non vegetarian, besan gatta, sev tamatar, lahsuni bhindi, tangdi kebab, rathodi chicken, junglee maas, laal maas, makki ki roti, roti, kheer,  inspiring story

Hailing originally from Surajpura Lotiyana village in Ajmer district of Rajasthan, Jithender and his wife, Renuka Tak, moved to Bengaluru with their young children having lost their automotive shop in the Ahmedabad earthquake of 2001. Facing financial difficulty, a chance encounter with a visiting relative at an exhibition who was looking for food to be catered led to the couple setting up a home-cooked meal enterprise. A family-run operation, they would shop, cook and deliver the food themselves, with their children lending a hand with the chores too.  However, work from home and the current situation bought their livelihood to a standstill yet again! Not one to give up though, this family has set-up a small one-table eatery in the east Bengaluru neighbourhood of Kaggadasapura, primarily to serve as a takeaway point for their delicious home-cooked Rajasthani fare, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I drive here to chat with the couple, watch them cook a laal maas, sev tamatar and other dishes, before tucking into a delicious meal coupled with the warm hospitality of this Rajput family that has an inspiring, never-give-up attitude. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!       

Tandoori Chicken Tangdi
Not cooked in a tandoor, but deep-fried and then fire-cooked with some ghee and spices, the chicken legs, marinated for hours in a spice mix, make for a juicy, char-smoked appetiser.

Laal Maas
Similar in flavours to the junglee maas but fortified with meat stock, this curry may get its colour from the Mathania chilli, but it is quite gentle in the manner in which it greets your palate.

GOPALJEE CAF√â | She Quit Her Job To Bring Authentic DELHI Style CHOLE BHATURE To BENGALURU!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQkDhPkHl50,"#vegetarian #northindianfood #bangalore

gopaljee cafe, delhi chole bhature, delhi style food, north indian, vegetarian, paneer bhaturey, chole, suvigya bansal, passion enterprise, inspiring story

Corporate executive Suvigya Bansal and her entrepreneur husband would scour Bengaluru in search of an authentic Delhi-style chole bhature. When they found none, she decided to quit her job and set up a small eatery that would endeavour to dish out the flavours of their favourite chola bhatura from Delhi. And so seasoned cooks were hired from Delhi, a complex 58-spice masala developed to ensure authenticity of taste, the right size of chickpea sourced to convey the flavour of the spices, et al. Barely had this enterprise found its feet early last year when covid struck! I made a surprise visit to Gopaljee Caf√© one afternoon in response to a plea from the eatery. Suffice to say my conversation with this passionate lady entrepreneur and tasting of the puffy bhature and ‚Äòmazedaar‚Äô chole compelled us to return to film an episode of Gourmet On The Road. Hope you enjoy this one, enough to pay them a visit if possible. Stay safe and happy eating!  

Chole Bhature
The bhatura is light and puffy yet with a bit of strength, to match the tenacity of the 56-spice blend masala that is delicately warming yet has enough depth to linger on the palate. The chickpeas, cocooned in the flavour of the masala, a seasoning of oil, chilli and spices, are stained deep brown by some amla and cooked such that they retain their shape yet yield in a creamy texture to the bite. The mandatory topping of dry, spiced aloo (potatoes) adds a slightly tangy flavour to the dish. If you like it spicy, go for generous bites of the green chilli pickle in between mouthfuls of the chole bhature. If you like paneer, opt for the paneer chole bhature, which arrives with a paneer and coriander mince, stuffed into the bhaturas, and also atop the chole.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) per plate, plain 
Rs. 125 (usd 1.7) per plate, with paneer
9/10

Lassi
The lassi is thick and creamy, garnished with nuts, and also provides cooling respite if you have ingested more of the green chilli than you can handle.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7) 
8/10

Gulab Jamun
The way to end your meal if you have a sweet tooth is with their perfectly browned gulab jamuns.

"Move Over ‚ÄòKFC‚Äô, Krishnappa Gowda‚Äôs Fried Chicken (GFC) Is Here! NEW GOWDA‚ÄôS FRIED CHICKEN Bangalore",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EICd1yv8l4A,"#friedchicken #biryani #bangalore

gowda fried chicken, fried chicken, gowda fried chicken, gfc chicken, chicken kebab, mandya recipe, mutton biryani, biryani, chicken 65, mysore road, bengaluru, bangalore

Fed up with labour problems in his vegetarian eatery of 35 years, Krishnappa Gowda closed doors 10 years ago to open a shop selling fried chicken, cooked by him to a secret recipe influenced by his Mandya roots. Such is the tantalising taste of this chicken kebab, that its fans drive across the city to stand and eat at this eatery located in a nook of Mysore road! An astute entrepreneur, and mindful of the popularity of his spice mix, Gowda has also developed packaged versions of the masala for those who would like to satisfy their fried chicken cravings at home. I make the trek to GFC and return convinced that this is perhaps the best local fried chicken I have tasted to date. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Gowda‚Äôs Fried Chicken
Tender chicken, marinated for six hours in an aromatic, secret spice mix, Gowda‚Äôs Fried Chicken is the sort that is tantalisingly tasty. The masala serves to coat the kebab with a delicately spiced crust and seal its juicy bite; the chicken is cooked perfectly down to the bone. This is the sort of kebab that needs no accompaniment in the form of a chutney or onions.
Rs. 480 per kilo (usd 6.5)
10/10

Chicken 65
A tasty kebab in itself, slightly spicier when compared to the GFC. The masala has formed a bit of a thick crust in parts as the chicken is fried, which lends a spicy kick. And then there are those parts where it is the juiciness of the bird that gushes through the palate. 
Rs. 480 per kilo (usd 6.5)
8.5/10

Mutton Biryani
The biryani here, made of basmati and kollam rice is served in a sumptuous portion, and is rich in the flavour of the masala when hot. Some pieces of the meat are soft and slide off the bone, and ribboned in rich fat, yet others with a bit of bite. As the biryani cools down, the savoury fat-laden flavour of the meat takes over.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)

JAGLI TINDI | This Couple Is Reviving Traditional DAKSHINA KANNADA TIFFIN After Giving Up MNC Jobs!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmreDOAWfNk,"#vegetarian #tiffin #bangalore

traditional vegetarian snacks from south canara, mangalore, kundapura in bengaluru, jagli tindi, jagli masala dosa, kotte kadubu, kolkatte, banana kesari bath, mandakki upakari, inspiring stories, couple goals, banashankari, south bengaluru 

An engineer and mba by education respectively, Raksha Prasad and Suhas Karanth began making plans to open an eatery that would serve traditional vegetarian tiffin of their native South Canara, during their courting days. Shortly after getting married, they gave up their MNC jobs and their eatery, Jagli Tindi was born, in a tiny nook in Kengeri, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, with a menu comprising mostly dishes gleaned from their grandma‚Äôs recipes, with ingredients sourced from Kundapura to lend authenticity to the taste. Two years on, this passion enterprise has moved to a slightly larger space in Banashankari, South Bengaluru, but the couple still remain hands-on, Suhas, in the kitchen, and Raksha managing the front of the house. I visit them to learn of their inspiring story, catch some of the action in the kitchen, before sitting down to a slightly indulgent tiffin session. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!
 
Mandakki Upakari
Made with a red puffed rice that‚Äôs tossed with their ‚Äòsecret‚Äô podi mix and onions, topped with grated coconut and plenty of peanuts. This is the sort of fun snack that one should share with friends whilst you wait for some of the other substantial tiffin items.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4)
8/10

Kotte Kadubu 
The kotte kadubu here is made the traditional way, steamed in cups fashioned of jackfruit leaves that lends the kadubu a distinct aroma. There‚Äôs a hint of tartness from the fermentation, the red tomato chutney makes for a sprightly partner to the gentle flavoured kadubu, with its tangy, slightly spice, sour and nutty character. The vegetable sagu adds to the nutritional quotient of this tasty tiffin.
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)
9/10

Jagli Masala Dosa
This creation of Suhas Karanth seems to be inspired by the 99-variety dosa ilk. The dosa is smeared with a paste of potatoes, spicy podi and ghee, as it is roasted to a crisp on the tava. Folded, flattened and cut into two, this dosa creation makes for an interesting snack if you are the sort who is acquiesce to pushing the envelope for what a masala dosa can be.   
Rs. 58 (usd 0.8)
8.5/10

Kolkatte
Steamed in a banana leaf, this steamed dumpling of urad dal batter, is stained lightly with the colour of the leaf. Slightly pasty and dense in its texture, and studded with whole peppercorns that lend their tingling touch. Whilst the red chutney adds zing, next time, I would also ask for some of the nutritious vegetable saagu to complement the austerity of this steamed dumpling.
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)
8.5/10

Banana Kesari Bath
The ripe banana heroes this velvety-textured dish from the start to finish, definitely order a plate of this to close your tindi experience here.

"Best HOMESTYLE GOWDA Lunch at Hassan‚Äôs Popular MAMATHA HOTEL | Ragi Mudde, Mutton Korma, Katla Fry",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0mikebHV5o,"#gowdacuisine #lunch #hassan

popular hassan restaurant, hotel mamatha, gowda food, katla fish fry, mutton biryani, mutton korma, ragi mudde, chicken fry, leg piece, gowda cuisine, naati cuisine, hassan food, mangalore hassan bangalore highway

I often find that the most memorable meals are usually those that happen rather unexpectedly. Like this delicious lunch that we savoured at  this popular eatery in Hassan, 210 kms from Bengaluru, a couple of months ago. Guided by suggestions from our viewers, I didn't quite know what to expect when I walked into a bustling lunch session here late one afternoon on our way back from Mangalore. But the memory of the rustic, homestyle Gowda dishes that I tasted here, lingers to this day. Suffice to say I would happily make the 210 km drive to Mamatha Hotel in a heartbeat just to savour the food all over again. Hope you enjoy the episode. I take this opportunity to wish you and your family a fabulous 2021. Take care and stay safe.

Katla Fry
Coated in a delicious spiced batter that complements the earth flavours of the freshwater fish, the katla fry is a popular dish here for all the right reasons. The crispened skin and the masala work well to cradle the fleshy fish.
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2) for 2 pieces
9/10

Mutton Korma
Notwithstanding bits of fat ribboned through it, the juicy chunks of meat have a bit of a bite. And as you chew on it, you are rewarded with the robust flavours of the curry. This is the sort of delicious mutton curry you would taste in a Gowda home in the area. Makes for a great accompaniment to the ragi mudde and steamed rice.
Rs. 170 (usd 2.3) 
9/10

Mutton Biryani
Flecks of fat abound in this biryani, that is redolent with the aroma of mint and coriander, and do well to coat the zesty, hard-spice laced rice with its unctuousness. The meat is mild in its flavour and benefits from being combined with the rice.
Rs. 210 (usd 2.9)
7.5/10

Chicken Leg Piece
The chicken is tender and juicy, the masala has penetrated deep into the meat that is cooked through to the bone. The spicy batter that crumbs the chicken has depth of flavour that is quite endearing.
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9) for 2 pieces 
9/10

Chicken Fry
The chicken pieces, in a slightly thick gravy, have bits of skin clinging to it.

"90-Year SHIVAJI MILITARY HOTEL, Bangalore‚Äôs Most Popular DONNE BIRYANI Opens Dine-In After 8 Months!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyoQhpF9cpk,"#donnebiryani #lunch #bengaluru

popular biryani restaurant, donne biryani, shivaji military hotel, popular biryani, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, mutton dry, chilli chicken, kaal soup, mutton liver, jayanagar, banashankari, bangalore, bengaluru

When Bengaluru emerged from lockdown months ago, Lokesh and Rajiv, the brothers behind Shivaji Military Hotel took a conscious decision to not reopen dine-in until the situation got better. This meant foregoing a substantial chunk of revenues and relying on takeaway business only, but this was something they were prepared to live with, for the safety of their customers and staff. So when they reopened the eatery to customers a couple of weeks ago, we lost no time in getting there to savour their hugely popular donne biryani and also report on the current experience at this 90-year old culinary institution that has a reputation for being jam packed with customers. We arrived to find certain measures in place, even though in precarious danger of being overrun by its patrons. Thankfully though, the taste of the donne biryani hasn't wavered a bit from the time we tasted it last nearly a year ago. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!

Kaal Soup
A warming, gently-spiced mutton bone broth, the trotters are cleaned well and cooked to melt-in-the-mouth texture.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)
8.5/10

Chicken Donne Biryani
The biryani is served steaming hot and is impressionable in its persistent aroma and spicy, flavourful fervour laced with green chilli heat. We tasted the donne biryani in takeaway mode where it is packed in foil, but it's not quite the same as when it is ladled onto a donne, a container fashioned of leaves. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
9/10

Mutton Donne Biryani
The biryani has a slightly smokey tone, and the spices imbued with the weight of the fat and the character of the meat, is rounded in its flavour as opposed to the chicken biryani. The meat is juicy and has absorbed the flavour of the masala rather well. This is the textbook donne biryani, served by this revered culinary institution for the last nine decades. 
Rs. 260 (usd 3.5)
10/10

Chilli Chicken
The chicken is moist, bathed in a green chilli gravy, this is certainly not a dish for the faint-hearted. 
Rs. 180 (2.4)
8.5/10

Mutton Pepper Dry
Tender meat braised in a deep roasted masala with plenty of pepper. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)
9/10

Mutton Liver Fry
The liver has a bit of a bite, its deep flavours juxtapose delightfully against the contrasting freshness of coriander and mint in the green masala.

In the year 1950, Subbayya Gaaru opened a small 10-seater mess in Kakinada in the East Godavari region of Andhra Pradesh to serve honestly-priced food of the land. Legend has it that he would treat each customer as a guest visiting his home and leave no stone unturned in feeding them. Tales of his legendary hospitality and traditional fare soon spread far and wide and this tiny eatery evolved into the legendary Subbaiah Gari chain of restaurants. I visit their newly opened Bengaluru outpost where I explore the kitchen and the making of some special dishes before savouring a lavish 30-item banana leaf meal that is served with dollops of neyi (ghee) and old-fashioned hospitality that can leave you bursting at the seams! I also brush up on some Telugu along the way. ;-)  Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe. Happy eating! 

Special Vegetarian Meal
If you‚Äôre looking to savour the traditional flavours of the North Godavari region in Andhra Pradesh, look no further than this special 30-dish Andhra Bhojanam. You begin with tantalising sweets like annavaram prasadam, poornam boorelu, junnu, savoury fries like the tamalapaku (betel leaf) bajji, garelu, before moving on to the procession of curries, lentils, tantalising rice preparations like the pullihora (tamarind rice), panasa (raw jackfruit) mukkala biryani and chutneys. The list of dishes served is far too long to be contained within this description, but suffice to say the food prepared by the master cooks who have trained in the original Kakinada Subbayya Gaari Hotel will hold your attention. But then, this is also the sort of meal that you need to savour at leisure, in order to do full justice to the dishes that are served with generous dollops of neyi (ghee) and old-fashioned hospitality.

This New NORTHWEST KEBAB & CURRYHOUSE Serves Tasty Kebabs And Curries Beyond The Usual North Indian!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yg2wpfLOKcQ,"#bangalore #kebabs #curries

new restaurant, restaurant with a cause, inspiring stories, north west frontier cuisine, kebabs, curries, tandoor, sigri, barbeque, vegetarian, non vegetarian, north indian food, koramangala, bengaluru

In the current climate of gloom and doom, Chefs Sanjay Tyagi and Shyam Sundar Bhaskaran, both seasoned culinary professionals with stints in some top Indian kitchens in the country and overseas, have launched a culinary enterprise to not just serve delicious fare but also, more importantly in our opinion, provide livelihoods to chefs and f&b professionals who have lost their jobs at some of the city‚Äôs top hotels. The result is Northwest Kebab & Curryhouse, a breezy casual dining restaurant in Koramangala, that is showcasing an interesting repertoire of dishes from the North West Frontier region. Barely a couple of weeks old, and with not too many customers at present, this is certainly an eatery to pencil into your eating-out plans if you are looking to taste ‚ÄúNorth Indian-style‚Äù of food that goes beyond the ubiquitous palak paneer and butter chicken! Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Mewe Aur Subz Ki Seekh
A delicately spiced kebab that offers the richness of reduced milk solids, dry fruits and the freshness of vegetables that intermingles with the gentle spice of chillies.
Rs. 289 (usd 3.9)
8/10 

Paneer Parathdar
Marinated paneer, that is soft and creamy to the bite, stuffed with a slightly spicy, tangy paste of sun dried tomatoes. 
Rs. 289 (usd 3.9)
8.5/10 

Teekhi Machli
A dish that is a confluence of the North, in the mustard oil, and the South, toasted curry leaves and tamarind, that go to flavour the masala that the tilapia is tava-fried in. 
Rs. 429 (usd 5.8)
9/10 

Tabak Maaz
Tender lamb that is braised in saffron, spices and milk, and then finished with ghee. At Northwest Kebab & Curry House, the braised meat is then coated in a light batter and fried. The juicy succulence of the fat and the ghee is what one tastes on the palate as the meat peels away from the bone. 
Rs. 439 (usd 6)
9/10

Chicken Behari/ Mutton Behari
A moist and gently flavoured grilled morsel of meat with none of the heavy handed spicing that one would associate with a North Indian Kebab. My vote though goes to the mutton version of this kebab where the tenderiser has imparted a creamy texture to the smokey flavours of the meat.
Rs. 389 (usd 5.3)/ Rs. 439 (usd 6)
8.5/10 / 9.5/10

Bhindi Musallam
Slit and spiced tender ladyfingers that are fried and topped with a rich musallam gravy of almonds and heavy cream, and garnished with beaten silver, rose petals and saffron oil. 
Rs. 289 (usd 3.9)
8/10

Methi Malai Kofta
Paneer and potato dumplings stuffed with prunes and nuts, cooked in a tomato and cream based gravy laced with the slightly bitter edge of fresh fenugreek.  
Rs. 339 (usd 4.6)
8.5/10

Murg Shinwari Karahi
A rustic preparation that one would perhaps encounter on a highway stop in the NorthWest, one tastes the untamed flavours of ginger, green chillies, coriander seeds in this chicken dish that is prepared and served in cast iron karahi
Rs. 429 (usd 5.8)
8.5/10

Nalli Rogan E Nishat
If you are a mutton lover, this is a must-order dish here. The curry bears the lip-smacking goodness of tender meat and bone marrow, the meat the sort that not just slides off the bone but almost melts away when placed in the mouth.
Rs. 499 (usd 6.8)

"Exploring SATTVIC Cuisine At THE HIGHER TASTE, ISKCON TEMPLE | Food That Satisfies The Soul!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHCBQq1SyFw,"#vegetarian #sattvic #krishnatemple

temple cuisine, sattvic cuisine,  indian food, vegetarian food, krishna temple, iskcon, rajajinagar,  bangalore, bengaluru

Temple food to many isn't about mere nourishment but a blessing from the divine. And when temple fare is presented in a culinary experience that is not only rich in its depth of traditions, but also celebrates diversity to appeal to all humanity, it is elevated to food that truly satisfies the soul. In a first on Gourmet On The Road, I experience the philosophy and flavours of Sattvic cuisine at The Higher Taste, a fine dining restaurant located in the serene environment of ISKCON Temple, Bengaluru. This isn‚Äôt a typical episode, but then the experience too isn't! Hope you enjoy this very special presentation, take care and stay safe.

Please note:
As a mark of respect to this meal that is served in a temple complex, I have chosen to not rate the dishes in this episode. Thank you.

Nuggekai Rasam
The rasam is flavourful and aromatic, you can taste the sweet lilt of fennel, the warmth of pepper and the weight of the lentils and drumstick drumstick pulp. The floating drumstick kernels add to the appeal of this nourishing broth.
Rs. 165 (usd 2.2)

Multani Paneer Tikka
The paneer is stuffed with the richness of cream and nuts, marinated in yoghurt, saffron and cooked in the tandoor. The peppers provide for a pleasing crunch, and the chaat masala cuts through the dairy richness and refreshes the palate. 
Rs. 325 (usd 4.4)

Potato Milagu Fry
Baby potatoes that are tossed in a sprightly spice mix, loaded with pepper, chilli flakes, cumin, crunchy, fried curry leaves and the fresh tang of lime juice. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)

Mango Rasgulla Chaat
Visualise a chatpata paapdi chaat where the paapdi is replaced with soft rasgullas immersed in the sweetness of mango pulp. If you want to begin your meal on a sweet and spicy note, this is the dish to try. 
Rs. 250 (usd 3.4)    

Raja Bhojanam
Paneer, peas and nuts cooked in a rich cashew, cream and ghee laden curry, topped with a touch of saffron, this curry is a touch of indulgence befitting a king! The spicing is mellow, barring the tingling prick of heat when one bites into a peppercorn. The soft, layered warki paratha makes for a comforting companion to the Raja Bhojanam. If you‚Äôd like to add a touch of spice, savour this gravy with the chilli cheese naan, stuffed with mozzarella that bridges to the creamy flavour of the curry, and topped with finely chopped green chillies.
Rs. 285 (usd 3.9)
Warki Paratha - Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
Chilli Cheese Naan - Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)

Vazhaipoo Murungakai Kozhambu
A ‚Äòcoconutty‚Äô curry with fried banana blossoms and drumstick segments. The drumstick segments are a tad fibrous, the banana blossom, deep-fried, lends a bit of a bite to this dish. The curry is thick, rich in its coconut flavours and does well to smother every grain of the rice.
Rs. 285 (usd 3.9)

Vetrilai Thakkali Satham
An unusual rice preparation that brings together the sharp flavours of betel leaves with tomatoes. Although the paan flavours are quite pronounced on the palate, the pulpy freshness of the fresh tomatoes helps cut the astringency of the former. Rs. 280 (usd 3.8)

Elaneer Payasam
A payasam of tender coconut, coconut milk, thickened milk for sweetening, this payasam makes for a pleasing end to the meal at The Higher Taste.
Rs. 210 (usd 2.9)

Paan Ice Cream
A sweet paan that‚Äôs blended into a homemade ice cream, this is a ‚Äòbeeda‚Äô the customary sweet paan that concludes a festive meal, in a dessert!
Rs.  165 (usd 2.2)

MANI DUM BIRYANI HOSKOTE | The Village-Style Biryani That Began The Early-Morning Biryani Tradition!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Pyyau6V1dU,"#hoskote #earlymorning #muttonbiryani

After trying his hand at a number of professions, Mani decided to pay heed to his parent‚Äôs advice and set up a tiny vegetarian eatery in a hut in his hometown on the outskirts of Bengaluru. The year was 1992 and his hometown was Hoskote, then a mere highway halt enroute to Madras. Soon Mani began preparing and serving a rustic-style mutton ‚Äòbiryani‚Äô inspired by his amma‚Äôs recipe. His early patrons, workers from nearby factories, truckers and drivers, for whom the biryani was a satisfying early morning meal to help sustain them through the day, having relished Mani‚Äôs biryani not only carried its taste but also news on this biryani shop. Year after year, the throng of customers to Mani‚Äôs eatery grew, and this also spawned the tradition of the early morning Hoskote biryani ritual with other biryani shops opening in its wake. Today Mani Dum Biryani Hoskote caters to hundreds of customers every Tuesday, Friday, and a few thousand on Sundays, but the rustic soul of the biryani remains, be it in the setting or the flavour of the dish, prepared only by Mani‚Äôs sons with a secret spice blend made by his wife. I drove out at dawn one Tuesday to watch the sons, Manjunath, Kiran Kumar and Chandrashekar prepare the biryani that first put Hoskote on the food lovers‚Äô map. 

Mutton Biryani
The only dish made at Mani Dum Biryani, is unique in its aroma that is redolent of an amalgam of spices combined with meat. Each grain of the rice has absorbed the procession of spices that go into the pot and the fat that is rendered from the meat, this is the sort of biryani that leaves behind a spicy impression on the palate. You can taste the heat of green chillies, and the flavour of the secret spice mix that‚Äôs made in Mani‚Äôs home. Some of the meat is laced with fat that melts in the warmth of one‚Äôs mouth, some pieces though can have a bit of a bite. This is a spicy biryani, and the mosaru bhajji, onion and cucumber raitha helps cool things down.

Tasting The Must-Try World Famous Hotel Diana Gadbad & Veg Cutlet In Udupi | A Legacy Of 60 Years!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIsPdbLTHUA,"#gadbad #dianarestaurant #udupi 

most popular vegetarian restaurant in udupi, hotel diana, vegetable cutlet, gadbad, ice cream, udupi ice cream, udupi hotel diana, gadbad ice cream, udupi, karnataka

When this enterprise conjured up the name Diana in the sixties, it was meant to sell cool drinks and ice cream in Udupi, then a sleepy town in South Canara. But because cool drinks and ice creams weren‚Äôt popular in this sleepy South Canara town those days, the Pai family decided to diversify into snacks. Their first creation, a vegetable cutlet, then a foreign item to the Udupi populace, took nearly five years to curry favour with the locals. Along the way, they also accidentally conjured up an ice cream concoction, the Diana Gadbad. Whilst the early days may have been tough, these 60-year old timeless classics are the most popular items on the menu today. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Vegetable Cutlet
A potato and beetroot patty that is flavoured with a seasoning of curry leaves, lentils and spices, this cutlet is a delicious medley of flavours and textures. The accompanying homemade chutney and sauce make for worthy companions to this Diana classic.
Rs. 75 (usd 1)
9/10

Diana Gadbad
An accidental invention of this eatery nearly 60 years ago when the restaurant‚Äôs founder, Mohandas Pai, put together a concoction of three ice creams, because he had very little quantity of each, topped with cashew nuts to feed a large group of customers who dropped in unexpectedly for ice cream. And because it was prepared in a ‚Äògadibidi‚Äô (kannada word for ‚Äòhurry‚Äô) it came to be known as the Gadbad. A layered creation with strawberry ice cream, eight types of dry fruits, fresh fruits, a special ‚ÄòHorlicks‚Äô cake, vanilla cake, no two spoonfuls of this delicious dessert are the same.

"Exploring SLV COFFEE BAR, South Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular IDLI, VADA Chain | 125 Years Of Experience!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugviKAza70Y,"#idlvada #tiffin #vegetarian 

sri lakshmi venkateshwara coffee bar, slv, slv coffee bar, slv idli vada, south bangalore‚Äôs popular breakfast and tiffin destination, most popular idli and vada, vegetarian, khara bath, kesari bath, tiffin, banashankari bangalore, bengaluru

When it comes to savouring soft idlis and crunchy vadas, all roads in South Bengaluru lead to Sri Lakshmi Venkateshwara Coffee Bar, or SLV as this string of eateries is popularly known. And it is no surprise given the fact that the brothers behind this tiffin house enterprise have over 125 years of combined experience in the making of the idli, vada and khara bath, beginning with extended stints at the iconic Brahmins‚Äô Coffee Bar where they learnt the trade. I met the brothers behind SLV, Srinivas Bhat, Krishna Bhat and Anantha Bhat at their flagship eatery as it completed 35 years last month to find out what makes their offerings so special.

Idli 
The idli is porous and the sort that dissolves in the mouth when steaming hot. The chutney makes for a flavourful accompaniment to permeate through the idli with its ‚Äòflowing‚Äô consistency and spicy fervour. One of the best idlis one can taste in Bengaluru. The butter, to be honest, is an unnecessary but decadently tasty indulgence!
Rs. 28 (usd 0.4) for two idlis; Rs. 10 (usd 0.1) for butter per idli 
10/10

Vada 
The vade here is double fried ensuring a crisp crunchy bite from the first bite to the last, on the inside it is soft and porous, speckled with black pepper, green chillies and curry leaves. 
Rs. 22 (usd 0.3) per vada
9/10

Chowchow Bath 
The khara bath is ‚Äòrunny‚Äô in its texture and quite loaded in its flavour, one can taste the aroma of the spice mix that goes into the preparation here. The kesari bath is lush with ghee, and studded with pineapple flecks and cashew.
Rs. 46 (usd 0.6)

"POLAMMA‚ÄôS MESS | This Eatery Serves Tasty, Affordable ANDHRA FOOD & Memories Of A Grandmother‚Äôs Love",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Npx11bTnC0,"#andhrafood #bangalore #bananaleafmeal 

polamma‚Äôs mess, popular andhra eatery for working professionals, students, families, vegetarian andhra meal, banana leaf meal, bhojanam, pappu, sambar, rasam, hyderabadi chicken biryani, chicken roast, mutton pepper fry boneless, chicken polamma, fish fry, bangalore, bengaluru

Every city has its celebrated restaurants, these are the ones that everybody knows. And then there are hundreds of tiny eateries that are almost unknown except to those they quietly provide daily sustenance to - office goers, working professionals, students yearning for a taste of home.... However, in the current scenario of work from home, offices and educational institutions being shut, these establishments that once were the lifeline of the communities they served are now finding it difficult to sustain themselves. 

In this episode, I visit one such Bengaluru eatery, Polamma‚Äôs Mess, named so by its owner, Jagadeesh Reddy in memory of his late grandmother who raised him as an orphan in a village near Kalahasti, Andhra Pradesh. I hear his poignant account of how this once bustling eatery is barely getting by, which is rather unfortunate given the simple but delicious Andhra vegetarian bhojanam that Polamma‚Äôs serves in addition to other meaty sides. I hope you will find within your heart the desire to support eateries like Polamma‚Äôs Mess. These need your support today to help keep them on their feet to continue serving the workforce, students, community at large‚Ä¶ when things get back to normal in the future. Take care and stay safe.


Veg Meals
My favourite part of the meal here. Simple but satisfying affair of rice served with a nutritious and creamy ‚Äòthottakoora‚Äô pappu, vegetable for the day, sambar, rasam, yoghurt and the staple condiments of pappula podi, ghee and ghongura chutney. The simplicity of the meal is reminiscent of what you will be served in an Andhra home.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)
8/10

Chicken Roast 
The chicken is double cooked, first in a deep-flavoured masala and then roasted in ghee with plenty of curry leaves and spices. Moist inside and with a slight roasted crunch, this is a must-order if you like chicken and prefer it sprightly and spicy.. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
9/10

Chicken Polamma
This chicken fry is fortified with the richness of cashew paste and red chilli powder, the sort of preparation that will make you sweat if you aren‚Äôt accustomed to chilli heat.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
8/10

Vanjaram Fry
The fish is fried in a tasty masala, albeit thin sliced, the sort that you would expect to find in a mess.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
7.5/10

Mutton Pepper Fry Boneless
The meat is soft, but the flavours of the masala had settled a tad; I also found the cornstarch a bit overwhelming, especially since we didn‚Äôt get to it as soon as it arrived on the table.
Rs. 220 (usd 3)
7/10

Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani
The Friday special at Polamma‚Äôs Mess is portioned enough to feed one, or two if you precede it with the Andhra veg bhojanam. There is plenty of masala and the chicken is moist and juicy, made in the kacchi akhni style. A recipe picked up by Jagadeesh during his stint in Hyderabad.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)

"Lunch At Mangalore‚Äôs Most Popular SEAFOOD Restaurant, MACHALI | Crab Ghee Roast Prawn Fry Fish Curry",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGcCSLomTxc,"#seafood #popularrestaurant #mangalore

popular seafood restaurant in mangalore, machali restaurant mangalore, manguluru, fish curry, fish fry, ghee roast, fish thaali, crab ghee roast, pomfret masala fry, anjal tava fry, squid ghee roast, alle piao, sardine fry, prawn fry, koliwada, kingfish, top seafood in mangalore

Given its incredible popularity with hundreds of seafood lovers who visit here for the meals, fries and curries everyday, it‚Äôs hard to believe that this restaurant is only six years old. I visit this eatery that has the vibe of a busy dining hall to indulge in a humongous meal, and along the way also catch up with its unassuming owner, Vicky Pai, who says his trying experiences as a young executive looking for affordable, homestyle food in a new city, spurred him to open Machali - to serve tasty, homestyle food at affordable prices. And going by my meals at this eatery, I have visited thrice already, and watching fastidious Mangalorans relish the seafood here, Machali certainly delivers, whether one wants to enjoy a sumptuous fish meal and fry for Rs. 150 or splurge Rs. 300. Truly, a democratic seafood restaurant that caters to all.

Fish Thaali
A standard Mangalore fish meal experience, on the plate there is a fish curry with a small piece of fish, some dry vegetables on the side, boiled rice, shrimp chutney, fried sandige and pickle. Servers walk along ladling more fish curry, a simple Konkani style lentil preparation, daali thove, and rasam out of buckets. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
8/10

Taru Buthai
Tiny sardines, fried to delicious scrumptiousness, the sort that you eat whole. Quite tasty!
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)
8.5/10

Prawn Fry
A robustly-flavoured fresh prawn preparation crusted in a Konkan koliwada masala. Once you get past the spices, you can taste the sweet lilt of the prawns.
Rs. 230
8.5/10

Boneless Crab Ghee Roast
Perfect for those who love crab but don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of de-shelling one. The lush ghee roast masala packs a punch more so against the mild flavours of the crab, the buttery fervour of the ghee brings the spices and the crabmeat together. 
Rs. 280 (usd 3.8)
10/10

Squid Ghee Roast
The squid was cooked to the texture that yielded quite gently to the bite, the masala though, seemed a tad salty to my taste. Perhaps a bit lacking in the ghee. 
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4) 
7.5/10

Alle Piyao
A flavourful Konkani curry made of ginger, onions and fresh coconut. The onions, starring both in the masala and the seasoning, are quite pronounced on the palate, as is a tinge of turmeric and the warmth of the ginger.   
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8)
10/10

Anjal Tava Fry
A plump piece of fish, flakey and pristine in its freshness, crusted with a punchy masala. You can taste the red chilli spice the moment you place the fish in your mouth, but the meaty character of the anjal balances against the spicy hit.  
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
9/10

Pomfret Tava Masala
The pomfret is burdened under the weight of a flavourful masala that has notes of savouriness, heat and sourness, owing to the onions, curry leaves, chillies and tamarind. The fish is moist, poached in a turmeric curry first, before being slathered with the masala in a pan. 
Rs. 300 (usd 4)

Long before the advent of the modern day caf√©, a tiny tea shop in Kalladka town, Bantwal taluk, just outside Mangalore was creating ripples, quite literally, with its ‚Äòdancing‚Äô frothy tea and coffee creations. I caught up with third generation owner of Hotel Laxmi Nivas, Shivaram Holla, to find out what has earned the Kalladka Tea, known in local parlance as KT, and the Rim Jhim coffee, concocted by his grandfather, Mr Lakshminarayan Holla nearly 70 years ago, a massive following through the decades. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Kaladaka Tea (KT)
A melange of thick tea decoction layered gently over frothy milk that‚Äôs fortified with sugar. The tea is ‚Äòkadak‚Äô and you can taste the tannins therein, but smooths on the palate when stirred into the milk. The sugar in the concoction is just right. 
Rs 15
10/10

Rim Jhim
An aromatic, strong coffee balanced with rich, creamy milk that is undiluted with water and fortified with just the right amount of sugar. The coffee used here is a 80:20 blend of coffee and chicory, which helps deepen its roasted flavours on the palate..

NOON‚ÄôS BIRYANI | This Family Serves ‚ÄòAsli‚Äô Home-Cooked HYDERABADI Biryani | Biryani Making At Home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc3N_xqUKKA,"#hyderabadibiryani #bangalore #authenticbiryanirecipe

When Mr Mohammed suffered business losses in Bengaluru 18 years ago, he was on the verge of retreating to his hometown, but his wife, Mrs Asiya Khan prevailed upon him to stay back and begin a home-cooked biryani enterprise, based on a recipe she had learnt from her mother-in-law in Hyderabad. She would cook the biryani at home and her husband was entrusted with the task of selling these in supermarkets. Little by little, they grew their biryani business, moving to a tiny shop with space only for a counter and three tables eight years ago. Over time, the reputation of Noon‚Äôs Biryani grew and built for itself a loyal clientele, many of whom would order takeaways. However, the current situation has seen their business dwindle down to less than half, and it was in this context that they reached out to us, seeking assistance to help spread the word. I paid a surprise visit and liked what I tasted, compelling us to return later to film this episode. We visit the elderly couple at their home, watch the making of a chicken and mutton biryani, before making a delicious meal of these at their shop. I hope you enjoy this one, do support enterprises like these. Stay safe and happy eating!

Chicken Kebab 
Moist and juicy, homestyle chicken kebabs that make for a tasty side to the biryani. Seasoned well and encased in a batter with a savoury, light crunch.
Rs. 120/ 220 (usd 1.6/ 2.9) for half/ full portion
8/10

Chicken Biryani
Each grain of rice is separate and every piece of meat is cocooned in the biryani masala, much like how Hyderabadis like their biryanis. The heart of the masala is the brishta, fried onions, and the spices that make their presence felt in the aromatic warmth that wafts through the palate. The meat has a bit of richness thanks to the khoa that goes into the making of the chicken biryani here, and makes for a worthy partner to the rice.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7) per portion; also available by the kilo
8.5/10

Mutton Biryani
Mrs. Mohammed‚Äôs mutton biryani benefits from a generous measure, as compared to the chicken biryani, of the fried onions and spices to complement the richness of the mutton on the bone, its meaty flavours fortified by some fat clinging on to the pieces. The rice glistens in its moistness and greets you with a gentle embrace, the edge of the spices tamed by the character of the meat, that also lends the rice depth of flavour. The meat is tender in parts and with a bit of a bite in others, its flavour delicate and warming, shining through the spices. If you are the sort who doesn‚Äôt like your biryani to assault your tastebuds with a spicy jhatka, this is certainly a biryani that will please your palate.
Rs. 290 (usd 3.9) per portion; also available by the kilo

"Breakfast Stop At The Very Popular SWATHI DELICACY On The Bangalore Mangalore Highway, NH 75 Kunigal",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr6a_PRsAfI,"#popularhighwayrestaurant #mangalorehighway #koppa 

popular restaurant for vegetarian breakfast, lunch, snacks and dinner on the bangalore mangalore highway, kunigal, koppa, south indian, breakfast, tiffin, thaali, north indian, sandwich, idli, vada, dosa, dose, coffee, vegetarian

When on the highway, you want to stop for a meal at a place where you will not only get your food piping hot, consistently tasty and sumptuous enough to keep you fortified for the journey, but also in an environment that is clean and hygienic. Swathi Delicacy, located 100 kilometres from Bengaluru on the Mangalore Highway seems to have built a massive following doing precisely that. In a short span of 8 years, this eatery has come to be the preferred dining spot on the route. On a recent trip to Mangalore, I stopped for breakfast here and also caught up with co-owner, Ram Prasad Bhat to find out that his family has a legacy of being in the food service space for nearly half a century. Hope you enjoy the episode, take care and stay safe.


Idli Vada
Idlis served steaming hot, the sort of welcome that would please a traveller. The texture of the idli is grainy, and comes alive when drowned in the deliciously flavourful sambar. The vada is crisp and crunchy, soft and airy inside. The chutney is green-chilli-hot and balances against the slightly sweet notes of the sambar. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
9/10

Kesari Baath
Not decadently burdened with ghee, the kesari baath served here is relatively austere. On the palate, one can taste the comforting, toasty notes of the semolina, mingled with pineapple flecks, fried cashew and raisins.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4)

The masala dose is crisp and kadak, smeared with a spicy red chutney inside and served, topped with a generous dollop of butter. The dose is thick and filling, the sort that would keep one sated for a few hours. The coriander freshness of the potato palya takes centerstage in this masala dose. 
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
9/10

Open Butter Masala Dose
A fluffy open dose, thick and ‚Äòspongy‚Äô in its texture, with a generous sprinkling of a sweet and spicy, powdery-crunchy podi that assumes a caramelised note when the dosa is flipped over on the tava. Contrasts playfully with the creamy potato topping. The butter seems like an over the top indulgence. 
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)

Grilled Vegetable Cheese Sandwich
The crunch of fresh veggies smothered with plenty of cheese in between toasted slices of bread. 
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2)

An exceptional filter coffee, the sort that lures travellers to drive on kilometres more, just to stop at Swathi Delicacy for a steaming hot cup of Joe!

Tasting Popular South Bengaluru Special Banana Leaf Meal At UDUPI SRI KRISHNA BHAVAN | 20 VEG Dishes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr8jUDcwW2U,"popular vegetarian lunch, baale ele oota, vegetarian lunch, thaali, udupi sri krishna bhavan, gandhi bazar, basavangudi, south bangalore, poori saagu, kadubu, palya, vegetable, sambar, tilli saaru, rasam, hollige, south canara meal, udupi meal, south indian,, vegetarian, traditional south indian lunch

When it comes to festive vegetarian indulgence here in Namma Bengaluru, one looks forward to a good baale ele oota,  a meal that is served on a banana leaf. And a popular one at that is the 20-dish special lunch served at the Gandhi Bazaar, Basavanagudi outpost of Udupi Sri Krishna Bhavan, a vegetarian eatery that first opened doors in 1926. In this episode, I not only savour this special lunch but also step into their kitchen to catch the making of a steamed ‚Äòkadubu‚Äô and the South Canara style rasam, known as the Tilli Saaru, by Ganesh, their ‚Äòadige bhatru‚Äô, or chief cook, who has been cooking here for over 40 years. There is something truly auspicious about eating off a banana leaf. I hope you enjoy this episode. 

Special Banana Leaf Lunch
This is an indulgent lunch affair representative of the flavours of the Udupi-Kundapura region in most of the 20-dishes that make for a typical baale ele oota offering here. The food is served hot and fresh, and conveys a wholesomeness that is pleasing and satisfying. One begins with a traditional grape juice and mosaru vade, menasinkai bhajji, kosambari, kadubu-chutney, couple of coconut-rich vegetables before proceeding to the substantial mains of poori-saagu, anna (rice) served with tilli saaru and sambar. Servings are unlimited, and the servers are quick and efficient in dispensing refills. Make sure you save space for the desserts, a payasa and hollige, before you close with curd rice, banana and beeda, in true South Canara style.

Established in 1926, Sri Janardhan Hotel has a history that spans nearly a century, and of its many delicious offerings, one rules supreme, the Mysore Pak. Such is its popularity, that this eatery in Ramnagar, a 60-kilometre drive from Bengaluru enroute to Mysuru, is called the Mysore Pak hotel. Made to a recipe tradition that hasn't wavered for decades, each batch of the famed sweet is made by third generation owners, Prashant and his wife, Gayathry. I catch up with them to find out what makes the Mysore Pak sold here supremely addictive and with a following that stretches far beyond the borders of Karnataka. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Mysore Pak
Drenched in ghee, the mysore pak is meltingly soft, and dissolved when placed in the mouth. The sweetness of the sugar is balanced by the weight of the gram flour and the buttery fervour of the tuppa in this dessert! A mysore pak worth its weight in gold!

"ORIGINAL MULBAGAL DOSA | PRASAD HOTEL | The Famous, Roasted & Steamed Dosa Of This Temple Town!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9fsLx27Mlc,"#mulbagal #dosa #vegetarian 

popular mulbagal dosa, prasad hotel, mulbagal, karnataka, masala dosa, dose, plain dosa, chutney, masala vada, onion dosa, popular traveller breakfast spot, highway breakfasts, madras highway, old madras road, tirupati highway, breakfast, snack

When friends encouraged Rajendra Prasad to begin a home-eatery in 1979 in Mulbagal, then a sleepy village 100 kms away from Bangalore on the Tirupati - Madras highway, he set out to make a dose that hadn‚Äôt been seen in commercial kitchens before. Borrowing a homestyle tradition of cooking dosas on individual tawas, ‚Äúhe pioneered‚Äù the technique of making a dose that was both roasted and steamed. And thus began the tradition of a scrumptiously delicious, crisp and fluffy breakfast treat, now known as the Mulbagal Dosa, that has put this temple town on the map for every dose aficionado. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe. 

Special Masala Dosa
Roasted first and then steamed, the form of the Mulbagal Dosa with its upturned edges mirrors the shape of the individual cast iron pans it is cooked in. Crusty and crisp on the outset, soft and spongy within, this dose comes across as a cross between a traditional version and an appam. Oozing ghee, the dose breaks in a crisp crackle that belies its thick and fluffy body. The chilli-warming, slightly sour notes of the red onion chutney smeared within complements the palya. For a spicier bite, taste the dose with the lentil chutney.  
Rs. 45 (usd 0.6)
10/10

Masala Vada
Crisp and flavourful, makes for a tasty sidekick to the dosa.
Rs. 6 (usd 0.1)
8/10  

Special Plain Dosa
The unique texture of the dose is heightened because there is none of the potato stuffing (palya) to moisten the dose; taste it before the masala dose to savour completely the texture of this unique creation.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)
9/10

Onion Dosa
More like a thick, fluffy uthappam. The hero here is the texture and flavour of the onion; you can taste the near caramelised, sweet notes of the fried onions, and also the moist bite of the translucent onions that haven‚Äôt been roasted to a crisp. A dose that can get heavy, the chutneys provide respite. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)

"Tasting INDIAN CHINESE Traditions At HAO HAO, Mangalore‚Äôs Oldest & Most Popular Chinese Restaurant",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4_cwFVkJrw,"popular chinese restaurant, oldest chinese restaurant, hao hao, manguluru, chinese family restaurant, mangalore, hongkong soup, crunchy fried chicken, chicken, mushrooms and bamboo shoots stir fry, honey spiced chicken wings, roasted and fried chilli chicken, shin min rice, dragon noodles, karnataka

When I moved to Bengaluru nearly 25 years ago, Chinese family-run restaurants formed a significant part of the dining landscape. Run by second and third generation immigrants who were shipped to India by the British over a century ago, the cuisine in these restaurants had evolved to integrate Indian influences, much like how the entrepreneurs of Chinese descent, now Indian citizens, had adapted to the tastes and traditions of the land. Since then, most of these restaurants have closed doors. However during my recent visit to Mangalore, I came upon one such establishment that has stood the test of time for nearly half a century. I caught up with Louis and Rosy Wong to find out more about the Indian Chinese culinary phenomenon, and to also savour some of the dishes on offer at their restaurant, Hao Hao, Manguluru‚Äôs most popular Chinese dining spot.

Crunchy Fried Chicken
A tasty duet of spicy chicken supremes encased in crisp, crunchy threads. Alongside a tangy, piquant dipping sauce, this makes for an interesting play of flavours and textures on the palate, not surprising then that this is ‚Äúthe most ordered dish‚Äù here.
Rs. 220 (usd 3)
8/10

HongKong Soup
A nourishing, delicately flavoured chicken broth that is topped with ‚Äòclouds‚Äô of eggs whipped into a soft meringue. There‚Äôs tiny diced of vegetables to give the chicken company with some soft noodles.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)
9/10

Chicken, Mushrooms & Bamboo Shoots Stir Fry
A wholesome assemblage of veggies - chinese cabbage, peppers, beans, onions, bamboo shoots - tossed with chicken in a light soya sauce. The garlic is quite pronounced, in the flavour of the dish, and also on the bite with whole cloves that are stir-fried into the noodles. 
Rs. 220 (usd 3)
8/10

Honey Spiced Chicken WIngs
Fried chicken wings, tossed with a potent dark honey-soy-chilli-garlic sauce and sprinkled over with toasted sesame and spring onions. The chicken is crunchy and moist, only wish the sauce had seeped all the way into the wings.
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)
8/10

Roasted & Fried Chilli Chicken
The chicken is cooked twice, first roasted, allowed to rest before being tossed in a hot wok with soy, chillies, ginger, garlic, spring onions‚Ä¶ rendering the meat the sort that pulls away from the bone effortlessly. Although spicy, the chilli heat is balanced against the umami flavours of the dish. There are also bits of chicken skin in the dish that provides a lovely flavour burst. 
Rs. 220 (usd 3)
10/10

Shin Min Rice
A one-dish meal of soy prawns, sweet garlic chicken, fried rice topped with an egg sauce that coats every grain of rice in its moist custardy texture. The chicken is slightly sweetesh with a prick of pungency from the garlic, the shrimps are a tad overwhelmed by the soy and batter.
Rs. 220 (usd 3)
7.5/10

Dragon Noodles
My favourite of the two main courses, this has chicken in a savoury sauce tossed with plenty of veggies, served with noodles - fried and soft, topped with an egg sauce.

popular seafood restaurant, affordable seafood, fish meals served on banana leaf, affordable seafood, udupi, malpe road, south canara, mangalore, mangalorean food, fish thali, fish curry, fish fry, kane rava fry, lady fish, pomfret, prawns, crabs, disco fish, karnataka

50 years ago, Thimmappa and his wife set up three tables in a rented outhouse in Udupi that they called home, to earn a livelihood by serving a simple meal of fish fry, curry and rice. Over the years, the fish fry, slathered in a secret masala made by the couple, and their sons thereafter, gained favour with locals who would flock to this home that carried no name. Five years ago, his son, Sathish Kotian finally put up a nameboard as a tribute to his late father‚Äôs culinary legacy that has endured decades since the eatery‚Äôs modest beginnings. In this episode, I visit Hotel Thimmappa Fish Meals to chat with Kotian and also taste some of the seafood delicacies here. Hope you enjoy this one. Take care and stay safe.

Fish Meal
The fish meal is a simple affair here, there‚Äôs rice, a tasty curry made with small-sized, inexpensive fish, a vegetable for the day and some pickle. And to complete this, one picks from the selection of fish fry (charged extra) proffered by attendants who scurry between the tables and the kitchen. Whether one has a budget of under Rs. 100 or 300, one is assured of a satisfying fish meal at Thimmappa.
Rs 40 (usd 0.5)
8/10

Kane Rava Fry
This was a plump lady fish, the semolina forming the perfect crunchy crumb over a veil of perfectly spiced masala encasing the flakey delicate flesh of the fish. One of the best kane rava fry preparations that I have tasted.
Rs. 100 - 250 (usd 1.3 to 2.7) depending on size
10/10

Disco Fish
The perfect fish fry for those on a budget. The fish is meaty, it is mild in its flavours and readily embraces the vivacious strength of the masala. 
Rs. 40 - 50 (usd 0.5 to 0.7) depending on size
8.5/10

Prawn Ghee Roast
The prawns are swathed in a robust masala, the flavour of the ghee complements the slight hint of sweetness in the prawns. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7) 
8.5/10

Fish Kebab
Kingfish deep fried in a spicy Koliwada batter, a touch of the Konkan coast in Udupi.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7) 
8/10

Pomfret Fry
The pomfret exemplifies the fish fry preparation at Hotel Thimmappa. Aided by the sizzling hot tawa and lashings of coconut oil, the fish has the perfect masala crust encasing its moist and meaty flesh. If you are lucky to find it on the fish fry tray, go for the biggest pomfret. 
Rs. 200 - 300 (usd 2.7 to 4) depending on size
10/10

Prawn Pepper Fry
The pepper intensifies the sweetness of the prawns, and the toasted flavour of curry leaf lends a savoury note to the delightful crunch of this deep-fry.
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2) for a full portion, I tasted a sample portion of this dish.

Tasty VILLAGE MEALS Cooked Over A Wood Fire At This FARMER‚ÄôS AKKI ROTI HOTEL | Needs No Sign Board!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMSwIPEQ-6A,"#villagefood #vegetarian #sakleshpur 

simple village style akki rotti and vegetarian lunch outside sakleshpur, village food, vegetarian, highway eatery, bangalore mangalore highway, akki rotti, vegetarian meal, thaali, raagi mudde, sambar, highway dining, highway meal, karnataka

Sixteen years ago, Balwant and his wife, Girija decided to open a tea shop on the fringe of their small farm abutting the highway at the foothills of the Western ghats just outside Sakleshpur, to augment their income. The tea shop soon began offering Malenadu style akki rotti to hungry travellers. And then meals followed, fuelled by Girija‚Äôs recipes and a wood fire, a simple affair, rice, rotti or raagi mudde, served with homely preparations of sambar, rasam, vegetable, pickle, papad, buttermilk and curd. Their following may have grown over the years, but the eatery remains as basic as it was when they first opened; I asked Balwant why he didn‚Äôt have a name board, and he modestly replied, ‚ÄúI thought I would put up a board when I improved the hotel,‚Äù meaning the interiors.

His son, Prashant interrupts to say ‚Äúwe are on google maps and customers find us so we don‚Äôt need a signpost anymore.‚Äù And that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs the simple yet tasty village style food served in a rustic setting here that‚Äôs a big draw for locals and travellers alike and earned for the establishment the moniker, Akki Roti Hotel Anemahal.

Akki Rotti
The Malenadu style akki rotties are served hot and puffy with homemade butter that makes for a simple yet delicious accompaniment to the toasty crackle of the rotti. A tasty vegetable saagu, curry made of raw banana and bengal gram, helps one make a sumptuous meal of these rotties. There‚Äôs a spicy green chilli chutney completes the plate.
Rs. 50 (usd ) 
9/10

Meals 
Choose from rice or raagi mudde served with a delicious homestyle sambar and a fingerlicking rasam that‚Äôs a flavourful play of spicy, sour and sweet on the palate. A dry vegetable for the day adds to the tasty nutrition of this meal, and there‚Äôs some homemade curd, buttermilk, happala and pickle to round off the meal.
Rs. 60

MALGUDI MYLARI MANE Combines An Iconic Mysore Dosa Style With Local Curries & Palav | Highway Dining,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY5UZR31Wus,"#nelamangala #bangalore #mangalorehighway

highway eatery in nelamangala, bangalore mangalore highway, mylari dose, akki rotti, mutton fry, mutton chops, chicken palav, mutton palav,  akki rotti, highway dining, karnataka

This highway eatery in Nelamangala, 40 kilometres from Bengaluru, is a passion enterprise of young entrepreneurs seeking to combine an iconic dosa style with local curries, palavs and more. Their conviction in the dosa, and a dosa cook with credentials apparently in the kitchen of the legendary Vinayaka Mylari, Mysuru, is even stamped in the name of this culinary venture, Malgudi Mylari Mane. I venture out for breakfast one early morning to taste the dose and other meaty offerings here, and return convinced that MMM certainly offers a refreshing change-from-the-usual offering for travellers on this stretch of the road. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating!

Mylari Dosa
Topped with some village butter, the Mylari Dose here served with a herb-enriched green saagu and coconut chutney. Its fluffy, porous texture also makes it a willing accomplice to be dunked in the curries. However, in comparison to the iconic Mysuru Vinayaka Mylari Dose that it seeks to emulate, it doesn‚Äôt quite manage the melt-in-the-mouth fragility of the original offering. But it is a tasty dose on its own.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)
8/10

Paaya
This broth typically consumed in the morning is the sort that jolts your senses awake with its spicing. Would make for a perfect medium to dunk some hot thatte idlis in here.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7) soup only; Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) with one trotter
8/10

Koli Kara
A Sino-Indian inspired creation of MMM, the chicken is juicy down to the bone. You can taste the heat of the fresh green chillies, the slight sweetness of some tomato sauce and the lingering warmth of red chillies combined with the umami punch of some soy. 
Rs. 70 (usd 0.9) per leg piece
8.5/10

Chicken Pepper Fry 
You can taste the grainy bite of the pepper alongside some garam masala and coriander in this preparation. 
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
7.5/10

Naati Koli Fry
Loved the coriander freshness of this preparation made of free range chicken that is deep in its flavours, fortified also by bits of skin clinging on to the meat. 
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)
9/10

Mutton Fry
A rustic-style dish, the meat is soft in parts and a tad chewy otherwise. The masala seemed a bit heavy on the salt though, thankfully one could dunk the fluffy dose in to tone it down. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
7/10

Mutton Chops
The meat is juicy and pink with a bit of fat, and the sort that peels away from the bone. The curry is thick and flavourful, redolent of coriander and fenugreek. Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
9/10

Akki Rotti
Rs. 20 (usd 0.3) 
8/10

Chicken Palav
The rice is a bit starchy to the touch, the punch of the spices quite pronounced in the rice. The meat is moist and juicy, savour it with the rice to taste the complete flavours of this tasty palav.
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
7.5/10

Mutton Palav 
Although the composition of the spicing is similar to the chicken palav, one can taste the flavour and aroma of the meat in the rice as opposed to the accent of spices in the former. The spice in this version is subservient to the flavours of the goat meat, thereby making this a palav that is gentle and rounded on the palate.
Rs. 220 (usd 3)

The Most Popular BIDADI THATTE IDLI At Sri Shiva Darshana Shashi Hotel | Bangalore Mysore Highway,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6BXiYnfg-g,"#breakfast #idli #vegetarian 

popular highway eatery in bidadi, bangalore mysore highway, bengaluru mysuru, idli, thatte idli, masala vada, chutney, vegetarian, breakfast, snack, karnataka

The origin of this iconic Bidadi thatte idli shop dates back to the 1950s when it came into existence as a tiny village eatery in the middle of nowhere (then), steaming and serving large plates of the acrey idli, an early precursor to the modern day thatte idli.  What makes Sri Shiva Darshana Shashi Thatte Idli Hotel the most popular stop on the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway today though is the owning family‚Äôs commitment to its culinary legacy over five generations. I stop by for a chat and to taste the idli that in a manner of speaking has put Bidadi on the food lovers‚Äô map.

Thatte Idli
The thatte idli is pillowy, it is as ‚Äúsoft as air‚Äù and breaks under the effect of gravity! Definitely order the butter with the idli, it‚Äôs a premium worth paying. The butter seeps through the porous structure of the fragile idli and makes for a bite that melts the moment you place it in your mouth. The chutney delivers a potent chilli punch, the potato saagu is creamy and provides for respite from the spicy yet addictive red chutney. The masala vada makes for a savoury interlude whilst tasting the idli. On the whole, this is an idli that is worth driving 50 kilometres for! 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7) for two idlis, two masala vada. Extra butter Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)

"Exploring 25 Years And 3 Generations Of RURAL Culinary Traditions At SVS MESS, Kolar",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGv6qfVLrxo,"SVS MESS, Kolar | 25 Years And 3 Generations Of RURAL NON VEG Traditions! Biryani, Chops, Kheema Fry

#ruralfood #kolar #karnataka 

popular rustic eatery in kolar for non vegetarian food served by a family, svs mess, mutton dishes, sheep, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, mutton chops, boti fry, fish kebab, paya soup, mutton fry, kheema, kolar food, non vegetarian food, biryani, non veg in kolar, kolar hotels, karnataka

This rustic eatery, located in Kolar, the milk and silk center of Karnataka, and within a two-hour driving distance from Bengaluru, is a labour of love spanning three generations of a family who come together every morning to serve up a meaty repast of traditional dishes that over the years has found much favour with the locals. I catch up with the family in their kitchen where the food is cooked as it was 25 years ago, on an ingeniously designed wood-fired stove. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Paya Soup
The paya is gentle and nourishing with the warming touch of pepper, an appetising start to the meal here.
Rs. 10 (usd 0.1) for a cup of soup; Rs. 180 (usd 2.5) with two trotters
8/10

Fish Kebab
A fish fry that‚Äôs best savoured hot, the flesh is moist with the skin crispened. The masala is flavourful and thankfully does not overpower the earthy flavours of the fish, I suspect this is a kaatla or a variant thereof, although locally it is referred to as silver pomfret. 
Rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
7.5/10

Mutton Biryani
A biryani that is mellow in flavours, subtle nuances of the aromatic spices are all that one detects in the rice, a combination of seeraga samba and the bullet variety. The meat is tender and moist, effusive in its flavour with a slightly salty edge of sheep meat. The meat combined with the rice makes for a flavourful mouthful, combine with the sherva to add a bit of a punch, the biryani is definitely a must order here if you come on one of the days they make it.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7)
9/10

Mutton Kheema Unde
Handground by the ladies of the house, one can discern the grainy texture of the coarse kheema on the bite and the warming notes of inger. The kheema unde is soft and flavourful, there is some egg that‚Äôs used to bring the roundels together with a bit of gram flour, but is barely discernible. Loaded with fresh pepper spice, 
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2)
8.5/10

Boti Fry
The boti is cleaned well and cooked with tender hithikabele (peeled hyacinth beans) which helps in toning down some of the ‚Äòfunky‚Äô flavours of the boti. If you love your boti, you will enjoy it.
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6)
7/10

Mutton Chops
A loaded chop, plenty of meat and some fat, that stands testament to the fact that SVS knows how to cook its meat. Absolutely delicious, the meat peels away from the bone, yet has a bit of a bite. There‚Äôs bits of fat floating in the gravy, that also adds to the rich, unctuous flavours of the curry. Savour this with some plain steamed rice.
Rs. 160 (usd 1.6)

GALLI KITCHEN By SHINE SHETTY | Inspiring Story Of How A Streetside FOOD TRUCK Saved A Kannada Actor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO0eiiIUexY,"#shineshetty #actor #foodtruck 

popular food truck run by kannada actor shine shetty, big boss kannada winner, inspirational story, vegetarian, mangalorean food, sabakki idli, mysore masala dosa, dose, bela kai neer dose, galli kitchen, banashankari, south bengaluru, bangalore

During a particularly difficult period in his career, popular Kannada actor, Shine Shetty took up cooking to stretch his meagre resources and feed himself. Cooking in those difficult times led him to mull the idea of setting up a food truck venture for his livelihood. Rustling up a loan from well wishers, he found a second auto that he could afford. Thus began Galli Kitchen, a streetside food enterprise, a far cry from the world of glitz and glamour that Shetty was once used to. Two years on though, Galli Kitchen seems to have changed the fortunes of its owner, and has now upgraded to a full-sized food truck. I catch up with this affable actor over an inspiring chat, and also taste some of the popular fare here.

Sabakki Idli
An idli that isn't too thick to hold, but weighty nonetheless owing to the sabudana or tapioca pearls. The aroma of the dill takes over the palate when placed in the mouth, the texture is a bit gummy. The idli is the sort that comes alive when combined with the chutneys, especially the spicy and sour notes of the kempu chutney. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
8.5/10
9/10 for the kempu chutney

Mysore Masala Dose
Shine Shetty‚Äôs ode to the 99-variety style of dose that would sustain him during his acting school days in Mumbai. The dose is crisp when it leaves the tava, but weighed down to a soft texture by the loaded stuffing of masala, fresh onions and tomatoes, when gathered into a tight roll. The spicy-sweet flavour of the podi is discernible above the fresh crunch of the veggies. Not a dose for the purist, but a tasty and filling one nonetheless.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Neer Dosa Bela Kai
This is how Mangaloreans love to eat their neer dose for breakfast with a lip smacking accompaniment of fresh coconut, jaggery and ghee combined together with a touch of cardamom. Simple yet delicious, and a must order to finish your thindi experience on a sweet note at Galli Kitchen.

"This Humble FAMILY Eatery Is Serving Honestly-Priced, Delicious COASTAL MANGALORE Food | FISH N DISH",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QtNtGZh_Fc,"#mangaloreanfood #seafood #bangalore

family run mangalorean coastal restaurant, neighbourhood restaurant, jp nagar, south bengaluru, fish n dish, fresh seafood, fish fry, fish curry, prawn fry, prawn curry, prawn sukka, ghee roast, kane, lady fish rawa fry, mackerel tawa fry, silver fish curry, curry, spicy mangalorean curry, fish meal, fish thaali

Harish Shetty, a native of Puttur, and his wife, Prema, uprooted themselves from their life in Mangalore five years to move to Bengaluru with their only son, Shaman, for his higher education. To earn a livelihood, they set up a small eatery in a corner of the city, with absolutely no experience but compelled by necessity and their love for cooking the food of their native land. Despite all odds, their tiny shop, Fish N Dish, prospered modestly over the years. The current situation brought all that to nought as they lost their meagre staff, most of their business, and were forced to fend for themselves to stay afloat. Alerted by our viewers of their plight, I paid an impromptu visit to find the couple cooking in the kitchen, serving customers and also cleaning up after them, assisted by their son. The delicious homestyle Mangalorean food that I tasted fuelled by Harish and Prema Shetty‚Äôs motivation to provide for their son a better life inspired this episode. Hope you enjoy this one, please support them and neighbourhood eateries like these if you can. 

Lady Fish Rawa Fry
A delicate crust conceals the lady fish, smeared with a gentle masala that‚Äôs seasoned to perfection. The fish is fresh and flakey, the perfect size to peel away at its flesh, definitely a fry to order when here
Rs. 200 (usd 2.7) for one fish
9/10

Prawn Sukka
The coconut is the perfect sponge to soak up the flavours of the masala and also the slight sweetness of the prawns. The coconut masala, toasted curry leaves, ginger garlic and green chilli combine supremely with the prawns that have been cooked to just the right texture. 
Rs. 300 (usd 4.1) 
9/10

Squid Ghee Roast
The ghee roast masala is warming and ‚Äòkadak‚Äô in its punch and laced with the generous ‚Äòbutteriness‚Äô of ghee. Would order the ghee roast here again, but perhaps with fish or chicken. 
Rs. 220 (usd 3) 
8/10

Mackerel Fry (Green Masala)
You can taste the fresh herbaceousness of coriander combined with the zing of mint and the spicy heat of green chillies. It‚Äôs a masala that‚Äôs robust enough to take on the strong flavours of the mackerel.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8) per fish
8/10

Mackerel Tava Fry (Red Masala)
A deep-coloured masala that greets you with its spicy punch and has seeped into the core of the fish.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8) per fish
8.5/10

Fish Thaali
A complete meal that includes a mackerel curry, mackerel fry, some vegetable, pickle, rice and neer dosa, guaranteed to satisfy, taste-wise and also fill you up.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
9/10

Silverfish Curry
A gentle curry with the creaminess of coconut milk and mild flavours of the fish, the fish is the sort that one can devour completely, bone and all. A traditional silver fish curry would also have a bit of tartness that I missed in this preparation. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
7.5/10

Mackerel Pullimunchi
The curry is nice and thick, however to a Mangalorean, it may seem a trifle compromised on the chilli and tamarind punch that one would expect to find in a traditional Puli (sour) Munchi (chilli). 
Rs. 150 (usd 2)

"Famous RAMANAGARA Biryani Ritual | TAJ BIRYANI PARADISE | Mysore Highway Mutton Biryani, Chicken",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zYoahr6n0g,"#biryani #mysorehighway #ramnagar 

popular biryani stop on bangalore mysore highway, ramanagara, bengaluru mysuru highway, mutton biryani, biryani trail, mutton biryani, chicken biryani, chicken grill, chicken al faham

For travellers on the Bengaluru Mysuru highway craving a quick biryani fix, Taj Biryani Paradise has been a popular pitstop for years. Located bang on the highway, it‚Äôs the sort of place that‚Äôs hard to miss with a number of vehicles parked out front alluding to its crowd-pleasing appeal. Curious to taste this much-sought after biryani, we stopped by impromptu on a recent expedition to the area. Watch the episode to know what we thought of the offerings here. Stay safe and happy eating!

Chicken Al Faham
The meat, especially the leg piece, is moist and juicy, the masala has permeated all the way into the meat. The chaat masala sprinkled over the bird is a tad overpowering, all in all a tasty preparation, provided it‚Äôs served hot.
Rs. 220 (usd 3) for half a chicken
7/10

Mutton Biryani
The biryani is stained saffron yellow, the rice fluffy, moist and flavourful and seemingly mellow when it greets your palate first with the aromas of the seasoning spices like cardamom. Golden fried onions, brishta, lend to the flavour of the biryani, however a few bites in one can detect the mild burn of red chilli spice on the lips. But that‚Äôs quickly assuaged when the rice is tasted with the juicy, fat-lined plump pieces of meat in the biryani. The meat is intense in its ‚Äòmeaty‚Äô flavour, slides off the bone, and definitely the sort that leaves an impression on the palate.

"Tasty, Traditional Fare Served By VILLAGE HOUSEWIVES | THOTADA MANE | FARM DINING At Srirangapatna",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms3RXegKiFE,"#vegetarian #traditional #villagefood 

a unique farm garden dining experience in srirangapatna, close to mysore, mysuru, village tradition thotada mane, guru dutt bharadwaj, mint lime, akki rotti, spinach rotti, raagi rotti, millets, vegetarian meal, thaali,  sambar, rasam, bangalore mysore highway, bengaluru mysuru highway, mandya district

Guru Dutt Bharadwaj quit his IT job in Bengaluru five years ago to move into the tiny village of Darasaguppe in Srirangapatna to look after his aging parents. With his parent‚Äôs traditional home as backdrop, his fondness for cooking led to the creation of Thotada Mane, rustic vegetarian dining amidst a verdant garden setting, that seeks to offer not just mere sustenance but also a refreshing glimpse into an alternate way of life. In doing so, he employed an all-women team of housewives from the neighbouring villages, working alongside them in the kitchen to serve up traditional family recipes, some tweaked with playful twists to ensure there is something for everyone who arrives here. I drive the 130 kilometres from Bengaluru to savour this unique experience that literally comes across as a breath of fresh air in the current circumstances. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Mint Lime
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Special Bhajji 
A tasty bhajji platter, the crunch of tomatoes, onions and coriander add an element of ‚Äòfreshness‚Äô to a deep-fried indulgent snack. Order for one of these as soon as you arrive at Thotada Mane.
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2)
8/10

Rotti Platter
A wholesome plate of three rotties, rice, spinach and raagi, topped with a generous dollop of butter and served with a niger seed chutney, uchilu pudi and curd combo, and a knock-your-socks-off spicy village condiment of green chillies, mensu. The rotties are ‚Äòkadak‚Äô, crisp around the edges, and loaded with flavour. The akki rotti, infused with onions, dill, green chillies, cumin and more, was my favourite. The spinach rotti is a rice rotti infused with the ‚Äòdulling‚Äô green notes of spinach, the raagi rotti on the other hand is quite earthy in its flavour. The uchila pudi, with its fibrous nuttiness, tart fervour of tamarind and slight sweetness of jaggery makes for a great combination with the rotties, especially when combined with the yoghurt. And for those with a festish for spicy heat, the mensu will be most appealing!
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
Akki Rotti 9/10; Spinach Rotti 8/10; Raagi Rotti 8/10

Meals
The sort of traditional meal you would taste perhaps if you were invited to a home in Srirangapatna. A sumptuous thaali weighed down by a dry palya for the day, saagu, sambhar, rasam, puri, homemade yoghurt and rice. You also have the option of opting for chapattis or parottas. The vegetables are fresh and crunchy, sourced from the nearby villages, the preparations tasty and comforting in their flavours. The Maddur vade makes for a nice, crisp touch, and the kai obbattu, served for dessert, helps round up this indulgent meal. The sort of satisfying meal that will lull you into a quick catnap in the lush green setting of Thotada Mane before you set out on the road again.

"Delicious VILLAGE Tradition, CHIBLU IDLIS Steamed In Bamboo Over Wood Fire | BABU HOTEL Halaguru",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogYXiAx0Bpc,"#villagefood #idlichutney #vegetarian 

ancient village tradition idli, halaguru, 80 kms from bangalore, bengaluru, idli chutney, butter, bene dose, dosa, tuppa dose, ghee dosa, red chilli chutney, kempu chutney, babu hotel, halaguru, bangalore kanakapura road, kanakapura road, bengaluru, mandya district 

The chiblu idli dates back to an era when modern kitchen conveniences of utensils weren‚Äôt easily available in villages, and so people would fashion cooking vessels out of resources handy. In the absence of present day idli steamers, village folk would steam idlis in baskets, known as ‚Äòchiblus‚Äô in kannada, made of bamboo, over a wood fire. And thus, these soft, aromatic chiblu idlis came into being. The painstaking effort required to steam idlis using this old-fashioned approach has caused this ancient practice to all but disappear. We travel 80 kilometres to Halaguru to savour this delicious tradition at Babu Hotel, a tiny village eatery that has been serving up the chiblu idli for over half a century now. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Chiblu Idli
The chiblu idli is aromatic and steaming hot, served with a dollop of butter and alongside palya and red chilli chutney. The idli is soft, porous and carries a tart edge from the fermentation, that the butter helps balance against. The kempu chutney has a good balance of spice, and the crunch of the coconut complements the grainy bite of the hurigadale (roasted gram). The palya is savoury with the flavour of the onions.
Rs. 10 (usd 0.1) per idli; Rs. 5 for butter
9/10

Tuppa Dose/ Bene Dose/ Masala Dose
The dose is crisp to the touch and fried to an appealing golden brown. Makes for a simple but satisfying tiffin with the palya and chutney. The masala dose is similar but stuffed with palya and larger in size, with twice the amount of butter. 
Rs. 10/ 25 (usd 0.1/ 0.3) for bene/ masala dose
8/10

Chitranna
A pleasing lemon rice preparation should you wish to round off your breakfast at Babu Hotel. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3)

Having burnt his fingers in a string of failed ventures, Chandrashekar, a pharmacist by education, set up a small eatery 20 years ago as a last resort on some land gifted by his father and with the recipes of his late wife, Chandrakala.

Though located in a nook of South Bengaluru, loyal patrons flock to Gowdara Mudde Mane for the meaty fare that Chandrashekar and his family dish out. Hope you enjoy this episode.

"Tasting The HINDUPUR Sandwich Tradition At HARI SUPER SANDWICH | Secret Recipes, Cheese & Chocolate!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbWvChZQfJI,"#bangalore #sandwich #streetfood 

popular vegetarian sandwich shop, hari super sandwich, street food, bread, vegetables, american corn sandwich, chilli cheese toast sandwich, chocolate and cheese sandwich, hari special sandwich, capsicum sandwich, local eatery, jayanagar, bengaluru, snack

Hindupur, a town 100kms from Bengaluru, in Andhra Pradesh, dotes on its sandwich, a derivative of the Mumbai bread and veggies affair. In Bengaluru, Hari Super Sandwich, has adapted the Hindupur sandwich to its own style with customised breads, a special spicy chutney and secret spice mix, the recipe for which is zealously guarded, in a medley of combinations that range from the expected chilli cheese toast to eclectic american sweet corn, chipotle mayo, and the wacky but popular chocolate sandwich! I taste five of their sandwiches to find out what makes this chain of sandwich shops such a rage in the city. 

American Corn Sandwich 
A texture-rich sandwich, with the sweet pop of the corn and the moist crunch of capsicum and onion. The bread is toasted just right to hold within it the creaminess of the cheese and the stuffing. You can taste the aromatic flavour of the spice powder mix and the fervour of garlic.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)
8.5/10

Chilli Cheese Toast Sandwich
Fresh green chillies are grated onto a bed of cheese, the cheese helps tone down the chilli kick for sure.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)
8/10

Chocolate Cheese Sandwich 
A combination that sounds unusual to the ear, but works well on the palate. The chocolate is not as smooth as silk, but is complemented by the creamy saltiness of the cheese and butter. It tastes almost like a chocolate waffle.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)
8/10

Hari Special Sandwich 
A loaded vegetable sandwich, inspired by the Bombay sandwich. You bite into the crispness of the vegetables, onion, tomato and cucumber, and taste the warmth of the chipotle laced mayo.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)
8.5/10

Capsicum Onion Sandwich 
You can taste the full-on vegetal notes of capsicum in this one, appealing if you like peppers, not otherwise. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5)

Kaima Unde Bhartad
Crisp outside and juicy within, all that one tastes in these roundels is the flavour of the meat and the lush mouthfeel of the ghee. There is spicing, but subdued to celebrate the richness of the coarse meat.

8.5/10

Pandi  Bhartad 
A preparation that breaks down readily in the mouth, releasing the flavours of the deep roasted Kodava ‚Äòkartha‚Äô masala. The fat has a deliciously jammy, sticky texture and has rendered well into the dish.

SN REFRESHMENTS | The AMAZING IDLI & VADA At This Not-So-Famous Eatery Could Easily Rival THE BEST!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APlGsKJ54g0,"#idlichutney #vadasambar #bangalore

popular neighbourhood eatery, south indian snacks, vegetarian, tiffin room, j p nagar, idli, vade, vada, chutney, sambar, masala dose, dosa, chow chow baath, khaara baath, kesari baath, local eatery, breakfast

Every city has its favourite dishes, and iconic eateries that are famous for dishing these out. Bengaluru too has its tiffin rooms and thindi houses that are destinations unto themselves and occupy pride of place in every must-eat-at list. However, unknown to many there are equally worthy eateries that have been serving neighbourhoods quietly for decades. They don‚Äôt get celebrated beyond the communities they serve and are quite content with no accolades coming their way. In this episode, I visit one such establishment, SN Refreshments, which has been a cornerstone of JP Nagar, South Bengaluru for its limited but much sought after refreshment fare for 30 years. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Happy Eating,
Kripal Amanna
Gourmet On The Road,
Food Lovers TV

Idli
The idli is soft, porous and grainy in its texture thanks to the proportion of idli rice and urad dal in the batter, and some rice rava. When dunked into the chutney, the idli readily absorbs much of it, almost falling apart in the process. The chutney is unique, the spicy note of green chilli is accentuated by some jaggery, before submitting to the fresh crunch of the coconut, the bite of the roasted gram and the flavours of the mustard seed-curry leaf oggarane (seasoning). A tasty sambar served alongside is almost glossed over not for any fault of its doing, but because the idli-chutney combination are superstars on their own. When here, enjoy the idli, ladled over with plenty of chutney.  
Rs. 15 per idli
9/10
10/10 (for the chutney)

Vade
The texture of the vade is textbook, crisp to the touch with a lacey crunch on the exterior, yielding and porous on the inside speckled with some green chilli, coriander and curry leaves. fried onions and minimal spicing. Crunchy on its own from the first bite to the last, the vade finds its soulmate in the chutney, its airy texture submitting to the embrace of the condiment. And if  you like a vada dip, the wholesome lentil sambar is happy to acquiesce with its sweet acidity of tomatoes and a whiff of asafoetida.
Rs. 20 per vade
9.5/10

Masala Dosa 
The masala dose is roasted to a golden brown with brownish striations. On the palate, it is crisp with a hint of tartness, and pleasing in its flavours minus the decadence of ghee and butter. The potato palya is creamy with the rich, savoury punch of onions. The chutney, though served in a ‚Äòghatti‚Äô (solid consistency), is just as impactful as its runny avatar served with the idli and vade. 
Rs. 45/-
8/10

Chow Chow Baath 
The khaara baath and kesari baath are cooked to a texture that is near ‚Äòrunny‚Äô. The veggies in the khaara baath change each day, this time around, it was the capsicum and one could taste its vegetal notes and the fried onions, alongside the toasty notes of the curry leaves and the sour twang of a drizzle of lemon. The kesari baath is pleasing and the sort that passes muster with the taste buds, making for a sweet end to a thindi experience at SN refreshments.

"This Famous HOSKOTE BIRYANI Shop Sells 1,000 Kilos Mutton Biryani Every Sunday | ANAND DUM BIRYANI",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV56f_1fTM,"#anandbiryani #hoskote #bangalore

popular biryani shop, anand dum biryani, hosakote, hoskote, bangalore, mutton biryani, kaal soup, chicken fry, anand biryani shop, biryani trail, inspiring stories

Anand was only 14 when he opened a tiny shop to sell idli and chitranna to support his family in his village, Hoskote, located about 40kms from Bengaluru. Customers requested him to sell biryani too on Sundays. What began as a tiny 2-kilo experiment 21 years ago has grown today to a massive kitchen that sells nearly a thousand kilos of mutton biryani on Sundays. And in doing so has placed Hoskote on the map for biryani lovers who don't seem to mind waking up at an unearthly hour just to get here to stand in a queue for an hour or two for a plate of the fabled Hoskote biryani that runs out by 9am and is sold only on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays. I drive out to Hoskote at 4am to find out what makes this biryani such a craze. Stay safe and happy eating!

Mutton Biryani 
The dominant flavours in this biryani are that of the fresh ingredients, the naati ginger, garlic, coriander,mint etc., followed by a veil of the aromatic spices. Every grain of rice is imbued with its flavours, and the meat is a combination of some soft, juicy pieces and some on the bone, that calls for a bit of effort to get to every bit of it, some fat included. The spicing is gentle and warm. 
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1) 
9/10

Kaal Soup 
There‚Äôs plenty of coriander and mint in this kaal soup; one can taste the gelatin that‚Äôs rendered into the broth. What it lacked though was depth of flavour from the spices, the sort of nourishing jolt that you expect to register on your tastebuds. 
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4)
7/10

Chicken Fry 
A tasty homestyle chicken fry, order a portion of this to add additional meaty protein to your biryani.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4)

NAIDUS ‚ÄòHygienic‚Äô CHAATS | An Engineer & Accountant Transform Their Father‚Äôs 35-Year-Old CHAAT Cart!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHLXBphiLPQ,"#naiduschats #foodtruck #bangalore

After years of working for a paani-puri vendor, Kuppuram Naidu saved enough to set up a chaat cart in the eighties in the far flung suburb of Basaveshwar Nagar in Bengaluru. His sons, Gokul and Sarvan, would turn up at the cart after school to help their father, and in between preparing chaat, serving customers and doing the dishes, catch up on their homework under street lights. The years passed, Gokul became an engineer, his brother a cost accountant. Unable to find a suitable job though, Gokul turned back to his father‚Äôs trade, and aided by his brother, has transformed the cart to a food truck. And not just any food truck, this engineer and cost accountant duo have aspirations to be the most hygienic street food operation serving authentic chaats! Made to the age-old recipes of their father who has since retired to farming, and with almost every component of the chaat prepared by them with the assistance of their mother, Shanthi Kuppuram. 
I drive up to Naidus Chats to see this for myself and also savour a few of their popular offerings made to that has made them the cynosure of their neighbourhood. 


Masala Puri 
Bengaluru‚Äôs popular ‚Äòlocal‚Äô chaat offering is served in an avatar that is spicy but doesn't subdue the aroma and warming spices of the ‚Äòmasala‚Äô that is at the heart of this concoction. The masala has depth of flavour, this chaat can be a filling snack with the white peas.
Rs 30 (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

Sev Puri 
Not a Mumbai version with potatoes, but topped with onions, spiced peanuts, chilli powder, seasoning, chutneys and sev, this chaat is a riot of textures. From the crispy crunch of the papri to the moist crunch of the onions and the spicy nutty bite of the peanuts, laced with the chilli-coriander-mint green chutney balanced with the tangy sweetness of the jaggery-tamarind chutney.
Rs 30 (usd 0.4)
9/10

Dahi Puri 
The dahi puri is burdened with potatoes, white peas, peanuts, chutneys and the aromatic masala before being topped with yoghurt, sev and boondi. A sumptuous chaat if you are looking for one. 
Rs 30 (usd 0.4)
7/10

Paani Puri 
The paani puri is light and chatpata, not too spicy or the sort that will singe your palate. The potatoes and chickpeas, just enough to give it a creamy bite.

Homestyle COASTAL FARE At THE LIGHTHOUSE RESTAURANT | A Homemaker‚Äôs Expression Of Food & Memories,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4oggjjVU0g,"#mangaloreancuisine #kundapurcuisine #bangalore

popular coastal restaurant, mangalore, mangalorean, coastal karnataka, kundapur, prawn ghee roast, prawn curry, fish curry, bangude pulli munchi, mackerel, chicken curry, kori rotti, squid koliwada, drumstick koliwada, neer dosa, ragi mani, seafood 

Married into a family of traditional restaurateurs, Prathiksha Nayak sought to create a dining experience that embodied her expression and memories of food growing up. The result is The LightHouse Restaurant, an airy space that is quite un-restaurant-like and more reminiscent of a South Canara home. Here, she serves coastal fare gleaned from family recipes and from her cooks who have worked in kitchens at legendary establishments along the West Coast. Keeping in mind her neighbourhood clientele, there‚Äôs a smattering of Chinese and North Indian on the menu too, but it is the dishes from the Kundapur-Mangalore belt that are much in favour here, as I discovered during a recent lunch here. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe.

Solkadi
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
8/10

Drum Stick Koliwada
The robust koliwada masala finds its origins in the fishing community of Maharashtra, and although its combination with the drumstick comes as a bit of a surprise, its flavours seem to find a happy partner in this fibrous vegetable. I only wished the drum stick segments were longer, allowing one to chew on the fry better.
Rs. 190 (usd 2.6)
8/10

Squid Koliwada
The squid holds on to the koliwada masala in a tight embrace, one can taste its spicy notes in every crisp bite. Definitely, a must-order here.
Rs. 300 (usd 4.1)
9/10

Prawn Ghee Roast
The ghee roast masala is modified here to incorporate coconut and some cashew, so the chilli punch is toned down a wee bit, but that doesnt get in the way of an enjoyable ghee roast. One that sits lighter on the stomach as opposed to a traditional ghee roast preparation. The prawns are fresh and cooked right; this is the sort of dish that is begging to be mopped up with a neer dosa.
Rs. 450 (usd 6.1)
9/10

Prawn Hinga Udha
A gentle poached prawn curry, its flavours laced with the edge of hinga (asafoetida) and a lashing of coconut oil. Makes for a comforting combination with the boiled rice, the sort of preparation that you would taste in a Konkani home. 
Rs. 450 (usd 6.1)
8.5/10

Kori Rotti
The chicken curry is robust in its flavours with a savoury onion punch, you can taste the coconut, the coriander, cumin and the slightly bitter edge of the mustard seeds in the seasoning. A delicious combination when ladled over the dry roti. 
Rs. 320 (usd 4.4)
8.5/10

Bangude Pullimunchi
You can taste the sharp tartness of the tamarind (pulli) and the spicy punch of the munchi (chilli) in the gravy. The bangude (mackerel) is fresh, the masala though falls a bit short in steeping into the fish. An enjoyable curry nonetheless, with the appam.
Rs. 250 (usd 3.4)

Raagi Manni
The raagi manni makes for a soothing and light end to a meal here.

Bengaluru's Favourite KHAALI DOSA At 50-Year HOTEL DWARKA | The Dosa That Changed An Eatery‚Äôs Name,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QetDuAGoYSw,"#khaalidose #hoteldwarka #bangalore

south bangalore‚Äôs popular hotel dwarka, popular breakfast, vegetarian, khali dosa, tomato dosa, dose, carrot halwa, basavangudi, bengaluru

For nearly half a century Hotel Dwarka has ruled the South Bengaluru palate, when it comes to the Khaali Dose, that though not as popular as the ubiquitous masala dose, is much revered by dosa aficionados. Intrigued, I visit this eatery to taste their khaali dose, and also discover that though its name may mean ‚Äòempty‚Äô in Kannada, there‚Äôs much that goes into its making that has earned for Dwarka the moniker, Khaali Dose Hotel. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.

Khaali Dosa
The khaali dose, served in a pair, is soft and spongy, topped with mini-dollops of butter. When eaten piping hot with a generous smear of the butter, it‚Äôs the sort that when placed in the mouth dissolves little effort. The chutney served alongside is the right consistency to impregnate the porous dose with its spicy fervour. The potato palya is flavourful, but the main act here is the dose, butter and chutney.
Rs 50 (usd 0.7)
9/10

Tomato Dosa
In stark contrast to the austere khaali dose, the tomato dose is enriched with tomato, onions, coriander, ginger, lending it a flavourful opulence on the palate. Though it is served with a tasty vegetable saagu and chutney, it is flavourful enough to be savoured on its own.
Rs 44 (usd 0.6)
8/10

Carrot Halwa
The carrot halwa is a ‚Äòrich‚Äô, sweet, and popular end to a meal here. I personally found it a tad too sweet with the tutti frutti.

Authentic NORTH KARNATAKA Jolada Rotti Meals At BASAVESHWAR KHANAVALI | At Dharwad Hubli Since 1963,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3dat4pNWTM,"#vegetarian #northkarnatakacuisine #bangalore

original north karnataka restaurant from dharwad, north karnataka, jollada rotti meals jowar rotti, maddike kaalu, moth beans, badanekayi ennegayi, eggplant, hesarukaalu, sprouted mung beans, sprouts, donne menasinakai, gurelu, shenga, chutney, jhunka, shenga obbatu, hollige, malleswaram, bengaluru, 

Kudlayya Karbasaiyya Ganachari and his wife, Susheela, opened a tiny student mess, Basaveshwara Khanavali, in their home in Dharwad in 1963. Soon, the delicious reputation of their home-cooked jolada rotti oota or meal spread far beyond the student community, compelling them to open an eatery in the town‚Äôs main market. 50 years on, this North Karnataka khanavali or eating house, has expanded to 12 locations, including two in Bengaluru, but the family‚Äôs personal touch remains with the founder‚Äôs sons involved in the cooking of the meals. In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, I catch up with the youngest son, Ravi Shivappa Ganachari, at their newest eatery in Malleswaram, and savour a satisfying jolada rotti oota. Hope you enjoy the watch, stay safe and happy eating!

Jollada Rotti Meal
This is a meal that is high in nutrition, taste and variety. The jolada rottis are light and fluffy, the sort that when smeared with some butter, marry well with everything on the leaf, especially the chutneys, kempu chutney, shenga chutney and guralu, with some yoghurt. The rotti wrapped with the jhunka, salad and the gravy of the eggplant preparation, is a riot of flavours and textures. The pulses, the moth bean and sprouted mung, are satisfying, the badanekayi enngayi and dhonne menasinkayi, the sort that will have you calling for second helpings. Certainly a meal that extols the vegetarian flavours of North Karnataka. 
Rs 150 (usd 2) per meal

Shenga Hollige
Served with a generous drizzle of ghee, the hollige is sticky in its texture and carries the nutty crunch of the peanuts.

EAT RAJA ‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs 1st Zero-Waste‚Äô JuiceBar | FRESH JUICES In FRUIT SHELLS! No Paper Or Plastic Used!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9wdDRub8cM,"#zerowaste #freshfruitjuice #bangalore 

india‚Äôs first zero waste, juice bar, eco-friendly, bengaluru, eat raja, popular juice shop, malleswaram, anand raj, raja, watermelon juice, chilli guava shots, muskmelon banana juice, banana beetroot juice, cucumber lime wellness drink, juices, smoothies, healthy drink

Eat Raja is the fascinating story of an engineer turned radio jockey who gave up his career to help his mother look after the family juice shop upon the untimely passing of his father a couple of years ago. And along the way, elevated it from a mere juice shop to the country‚Äôs first zero waste juice bar. Where there is no plastic, no paper used, where imaginative juice concoctions are served in vestibules fashioned out of fruit shells, highly instagrammable, that after serving their purpose are then gathered to be fed to cows. I catch up with zero-waste evangelist, Anand Raj aka Raja, taste six of his slurp-worthy creations, and leave with the one thought that we must all pay heed to what we waste. Take care and stay safe.

Waterless Watermelon Juice
Refreshingly thick juice, unfiltered and sweetened with the natural sugars of the fruit. 
Rs 50 (usd 0.7) 
8/10

Chilli Guava Juice Shots
The best seller at Eat Raja, pink guava that‚Äôs juiced and served in its shell with a chilli-salt rim that contrasts sharply against the sweetness of the fruit. You are served five shots to a portion, and the bonus here, you get to relish the juice and eat the fruit too! 
Rs 50 (usd 0.7) 
10/10

Muskmelon Banana Juice
Served in a muskmelon cup, the tropical notes of the muskmelon pairs deliciously with the ripe sweet ripeness of the Chandrabaley banana. The flavours of this delightful combination linger long on the palate even after you have finished drinking the juice. 
Rs 50 (usd 0.7) 
10/10

Cucumber Lime Detox
Raja‚Äôs ‚Äúinside the fruit‚Äù thinking manifests itself in a ‚Äúhealthy-tasting‚Äù puree of cucumber spiked with lime that‚Äôs served in the shell with a chilli-salt rim. Whilst the salty rim didn‚Äôt appeal to my palate in this combination, this certainly is a juice that would be great on a hot summer‚Äôs day.
Rs 50 (usd 0.7) 
7/10

Banana Beetroot Juice
A thick and creamy concoction that‚Äôs served in a banana skill shell! The banana dominates on the palate, with a touch of sugar, the beetroot whispers its faint earthiness.

The year was 1993. A Punjabi from Delhi with a young family, hotel management degree from the US and a stint with a leading hospitality chain, landed in Bengaluru on business. Taken in by the city‚Äôs salubrious weather, he set up a tiny 400 sq. ft. restaurant called Treat to serve up ""Saddi Dilli"" style Punjabi food. 27 years on, Treat has integrated well into Indiranagar, Bengaluru‚Äôs culinary landscape with a loyal following in the area and beyond. Its founder, Pramod Chaudhry is now joined by his son and daughter, as they look to take on the challenges brought on by the current pandemic. I visit them, and savour many of the hearty Punjabi kebabs and curries, vegetarian and non-vegetarian, that helped this neighbourhood eatery make it to many a Bangalorean‚Äôs speed-dial way before delivery apps appeared on the scene! Hope you enjoy this one, take care and stay safe.

"This Mother-Son Duo Sell Nearly 50000 Idlis Each Month | IYER IDLY, Serving Idlis Only For 19 Years!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2cgBUat0Wg,"#idlichutney #popularbreakfasts #bangalore

iyer idly, east bengaluru‚Äôs most popular idli shop, popular bangalore breakfast, idli chutney, healthy breakfast

Iyer Idly, a tiny shop opened 19 years ago, selling idli batter to a community of busy scientists and engineers in the East Bengaluru neighbourhood of Vignan Nagar. In time, the shop added hot idlis in response to customer requests, and has since served only the idli and nothing else! The founder, Mr. M K Mahadevan passed on a few years ago, but his legacy continues with his wife, Mrs. Uma Devan and son, Krishnan Mahadevan, who till date make idlis the old-fashioned way, each batch of rice and urad dal batter fermented overnight, before being steamed and served with a spicy chutney that has won numerous fans for Iyer Idly not just in its neighbourhood but across the city. Fans who savour nearly 50,000 of these hot, fluffy idlis each month. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.

Idli Chutney 
The idlis are made the traditional way from idli rice and urad dal that is ground to a batter and fermented overnight. The result is an idli that is soft and grainy, slightly pasty and aromatic, with a touch of tartness. It is served with a spicy chutney that some say is more popular than the idli here. This combination though is definitely the sort that makes Iyer Idly a sought after destination for what is perhaps one of Bengaluru‚Äôs favourite breakfast dishes. 
Rs 10 (usd ) per idli

"Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular Drive-In ROOMALI ROLLS At KABAB KORNER | Chicken Roomali Roll, Malai Kebab",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym7XyZyfQnk,"#roomaliroll #kabab #bangalore

popular drive-in, car service eatery, kabab korner, rolls, kebabs, roomali roti, curries, north indian, chicken roomali roll, paneer, malai kabab, hariyali kabab, st marks road, bangalore

When it came to grabbing a quick bite of mostly kebabs and rolls, Kabab Korner, located in what was once upon a time the heart of Bangalore‚Äôs nightlife and entertainment action, ruled. One pulled up at the eatery, placed an order and would be relishing piping hot food served in the car a few minutes later. Over the years the action moved elsewhere, the number of vehicles on the city‚Äôs roads exploded manifold making it difficult to park, and ergo, Kabab Korner seems to have all but dropped from radar. In this short episode, I take advantage of the current lull in traffic and head back here after many years to relive old memories of their chicken roomali roll and a couple of kebabs. Hope you enjoy this one, stay safe and happy eating!

Chicken Roomali Roll
Served in a soft roomali roti with enough shredded chicken tikka and plenty of onions tossed with spices, the kabab korner chicken roomali roti still makes for a satisfying snack. 
Rs. 210 (usd 2.8)

Malai Kebab

PURNABRAMHA Maharashtrian Vegetarian Cuisine| A Woman‚Äôs Tribute To Authentic Flavours Of Her Land,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2GuLfYGhmM,"#vegetarian #jayantikathale #bangalore

purnabramha, popular maharashtrian restaurant, jayanti kathale, lady entrepreneur, woman enterprise, maharashtrian vegetarian cuisine, bangalore, vada pav, sabudana vada, kothmir vadi, vada, maaswadi rasa, narayangaon, maharashtra, pune, bharleli vaangi, eggplant, varan bhaat, dal rice, modak, ganesh chaturthi, puran poli, shirval, 

A 27-hour flight from Australia to Bengaluru sans any vegetarian food for her husband and child spurred Jayanti Kathale to give up her career as an IT professional and set up an enterprise fuelled by the mission of propagating vegetarian Maharashtrian cuisine across the globe. With a humble beginning, selling modaks online, Purnabramha has evolved into a full-fledged restaurant offering with multiple centres in India and overseas. I catch up with this firebrand entrepreneur at one of her restaurants in Bengaluru, watch the making of a unique maaswadi rassa, a dish from Narayangaon, before sitting down to a satisfying Maharashtrian meal that begins with an expected vada pav and sabudana vada but travels far beyond. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!


Solkadi
An appetising start to the milk, sour kokum extract infused in spiced coconut milk.
Rs. 150 (usd 2)
8/10

Vada Pav
The vada pav here is served in the traditional Maharashtrian style, a lightly flavoured batata vada in a laadi pav with a generous rub of kanda-lehsun chutney, choora, fried batter pearls for crunch, and lavangi, salted and fried green chillies. 
Rs. 35 (usd 0.5)
8.5/10

Sabudana Vada
A textbook sabudana vada, crisp and crunchy on the outside and moist and yielding inside. The spicing is minimal in keeping with its reputation as a ‚Äòupavaschi faraal‚Äô or fasting snack. The sweet and sour yoghurt dip is a perky accompaniment to the vada.
Rs. 154 (usd 2) for 6 pieces.
8/10

Kothmir Vadi
The sort of snack that you would find in a Maharashtrian home. Generous amounts of coriander (kothmir, in Marathi) combine with spices and chickpea flour in two versions, steamed and fried. I preferred the fried version. 
Rs. 176 (usd 2.3)
7/10

Combo Main Course Platter
A great plate to taste the depth and variety of Maharashtrian cuisine in dishes that aren‚Äôt commonplace. The spicy rasa grips you by the throat, the soft and wholesome tandala chi bhakri (rice rotti) helps tone down the spicy fervour of the rasa. The maaswadi, a vegetarian‚Äôs imaginative take on the bone and marrow concept, is an interesting play of flavours and textures - smooth, spicy chickpea paste that‚Äôs stuffed with a mixture that comprises sesame seeds, coconut, peanuts, etc. if you like it spicy, combine the bhakri with the chilli thecha and onions. The bharleli vangi offers a flavourful bite, swathed in a nutty peanut based gravy,
Rs. 280 (usd 3.7)
9/10

Thup Varan Bhat Nimbu 
A simple, soul-pleasing plate of mildly flavoured daal (varan) seasoned with toasted thup (ghee), served with rice. There‚Äôs some methkut, a five-lentil, spice and asafoetida concoction, on the plate for added punch.
Rs. 110 (usd 1.5)
8.5/10

Shirval
A vegan-friendly, low on sweetness dessert, made of rice flour that‚Äôs collected into a dough, poached, before being pressed into noodles that are then steamed. The steamed noodles, combined with coconut cream, a touch of jaggery and almond flakes, is the delicate sort that dissolves when placed in the mouth. 
Rs. 350 (usd 4.7)
8/10

Modak
Lord Ganesha‚Äôs favourite sweet, Purnabramha‚Äôs modak is a must-order. Within the austere exterior of the modak lurks a caramelised, coconutty mixture, fortified with reduced milk, that will sing to your palate. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2) for 4 pieces.
10/10

Puran Poli
Purnabramha has sold 750,000 of these, and for good reason. Jaggery-sweetened chickpea paste flavoured with a touch of nutmeg and rolled in a wheat dough, this is the sort of dessert that‚Äôs best enjoyed with plenty of thup (ghee)! 
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2)

"CTR (Shri Sagar) Reopens To Serve Its Popular BENNE MASALA DOSA | Idli Vada, Set Dosa, Poori Saagu",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c6PdX_IxGw,"#ctr #vegetarian #bangalore

central tiffin room, ctr malleswaram, shri sagar, bangalore‚Äôs most famous benne masala dose, vegetarian, breakfast, tiffin, south canara cuisine, popular eatery, south indian, karnataka, kesari bath, masala dosa, set dosa, idli vada, chutney, poori bhaji, filter coffee

Bengaluru loves its masala dosa, or doseÃÅ as this supremely satisfying treat is called locally, with fans vociferously claiming top honours for their favourite eatery. One such much-loved dosa destination is CTR (Shri Sagar) in Malleswaram, which has catered to customers since 1952. I visit CTR as they emerge from lockdown to taste their benne masala doseÃÅ and a couple of other breakfast favourites, and also take a look at how this eatery has geared up for life in a post-covid world. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!

CTR - SHRI SAGAR | Bangalore‚Äôs Most Popular BENNE MASALA DOSA, GOLI BAJJI, IDLI & More | Malleswaram https://youtu.be/Ylb6ISVUxLY

Idli Vada
The vada is crisp and crunchy with air bubbles within that make it a great medium to soak up the flavourful sambar. The idli has a bit of a tart edge that benefits from mingling with the thenginakayi (coconut) chutney.
Rs. 52 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Poori Saagu
If you‚Äôre looking for a filling snack, this would be it. Three pooris accompany a vegetable saagu, the veggies retain their crisp crunch, if you‚Äôre looking to perk things up, combine it with the chutney that has a sharp green chilli edge.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Benne Masala Dosa
This butter-drenched gold-hued dose is blessed with the perfect gentle crackle. On the palate, one tastes the lushness of the homemade butter that envelopes every bite of the dose, the palya and the chutney with its delicious veil. If you need one reason to visit CTR, this would be it.
Rs. 57 (usd 0.8)
10/10

Set Dose
An exact opposite to the buttery masala dose, the set dose is almost austere. It‚Äôs spongy texture though makes it the perfect medium to soak up the flavours of the vegetable saagu and chutney. If you‚Äôre looking for a healthy dosa fix, this would be it.
Rs. 52 (usd 0.7)
8.5/10

Kesari Bath 
Dripping in ghee and topped with toasted cashews and raisins, the grainy kesari bath almost melts away when placed in the mouth. The cashew provides an element of nuttiness and the raisin, pops of sweetness to this semolina preparation.
Rs. 29 (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

Coffee 
A fitting end to a meal here.
Rs. 15 (usd 0.2)

"Tasting East Bengaluru‚Äôs Insanely Popular  MALLIKA WOOD-FIRED BIRYANI | Mutton Curry, Chicken Fry",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWZ5DBqW_wU,"#mallikabiriyani #muttonbiryani #bangalore

Bengaluru‚Äôs Newest Biryani Craze, Mallika Biriyani, sells over 500 kilos of meat biryanis every weekend! Mutton biryani, chicken biryani, homestyle mutton curry, chicken fry, liver fry, boti fry, raagi mudde, kothanur, east bangalore

Mallika Biriyani is the fascinating story of a computer engineer who began a biryani shop six years ago with an investment of Rs. 10,000 after a string of failed ventures. In the early days, he would procure a kilo of mutton each day, today the shop has evolved to a bustling biryani destination which procures over 500 kilos of meat on weekends to cater to the thronging crowds here. I make a 20-km trek through town to the far flung suburb of Kothanur in East Bengaluru to catch up with Venkatesh for a close look at his enterprise, and also taste the five or six dishes on offer here including his unique wood-fired biryani creation which comes across as a delicious confluence of various styles. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating!

Mutton Curry
A pleasing homestyle mutton preparation that‚Äôs cooked slowly on a wood fire, the fat in the meat renders into the gravy giving the curry a lip-smacking unctuous richness. The meat slides off the bone, the curry is a great combination with the rice and raagi mudde. If you need one reason to make the trip to Mallika, this would be it!
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)
10/10

Chicken Fry
Made in a flavour coriander-greenchilli-coriander masala, this is a zesty chicken dish. The meat is cooked perfectly down to the bone. 
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
8/10

Boti Fry
The boti is soft, cooked well and spiked with loads of pepper. Its only fault however, its sandy griminess on the bite, which can be difficult to get past when you are eating offal.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)
6/10

Liver Fry
A preparation, identical to the pepper-laced boti fry, it‚Äôs a pity the flavourful warmth of the masala could not penetrate the ‚Äòtough-on-the-bite liver.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.3)
7/10

Chicken Biryani
The biryanis are served in large portions, there‚Äôs plenty of rice, and 5 or 6 pieces of chicken, which makes it a great biryani to share. On the nose, there‚Äôs the smokey character from the wood-fire, you can taste the depth of flavour in the rice from the spices. The meat is moist, though mellow in its flavours and benefits from being eaten with the flavourful rice, that is a mixture of two varietals, the ‚Äòstarchy‚Äô short-grained seeraga samba and the ‚Äòlow on starch‚Äô medium-sized-grain, bullet variety.
Rs. 130 (usd 1.7)
8.5/10

Mutton Biryani
Seven or eight pieces of meat in a mutton biryani at Rs. 230 makes it great in terms of value, and perhaps also lends to its mass appeal. The spicing and masala is identical to the chicken version, but the character of the mutton, with a bit of fat, imbues the biryani with a mellow, warming flavour note that‚Äôs more rounded on the palate. The meat is juicy, and has a bit of a bite. If you like your flavours a bit punchy, taste it with the sherva, the gravy of the mutton curry.
Rs. 230 (usd 3.1)

Bengaluru‚Äôs Popular TAAZA THINDI Removes Best Selling MASALA DOSA From Menu To Prevent Overcrowding!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_vmZ32MXMI,"#taazathindi #vegetarian #bangalore

taaza thindi, must-visit for its tasty south indian tiffin, hygienically prepared and affordable! vegetarian, breakfast, tiffin, south canara cuisine, taaza thindi, jayanagar, bengaluru, bangalore, lunch, popular eatery, south indian, karnataka, masala dose, masala dosa, idli, vada, chow chow baath, khaara baath, kesari baath, coffee

When it comes to the hygiene aspect in a mainstream eatery, Taaza Thindi rivals the best with its clean approach to cooking and serving delicious South Indian tiffin fare. Not due to current covid 19 compulsions, but from when they began operations six years ago. In the current scenario, they have taken matters a step further as I discovered when I visited their flagship Jayanagar restaurant recently to savour their best selling masala dose. Turns out they have stopped making dosas altogether just because the three to four-minute ensuing wait for one would have customers crowding, making it difficult to maintain social distancing owing to space issues at this outlet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge loss financially especially in these difficult times‚Äù, say the founders, but ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt want to compromise with the wellbeing of our customers and employees!‚Äù 
Mildly disappointed with the absence of the dosa, I sought solace in their equally pleasing idli vada and chow chow baath combo, the latter featuring a comforting khaara baath made with bansi rawa. Hope you enjoy this episode, stay safe and happy eating.

Previous Taaza Thindi video link:
HYGIENIC, TASTY & AFFORDABLE! Tiffin At TAAZA THINDI | Most Popular SOUTH INDIAN SNACK Destination https://youtu.be/1yIYi4pRZm8

Idli Vada
The idli is grainy and porous in texture allowing for the ‚Äòrunny‚Äô chutney to seep through and imbue it with its spicy fervour. The vada exudes a near ‚Äòbiscuity‚Äô crunch and is simple and clean in its flavours. 
Rs. 12 (usd 0.2) per idli/ vada
8.5/10

Chowchow baath
Made with bansi wheat rava, the khara baath is porridge-like in its consistency. On the palate, it exudes savoury, spicy flavours tinged with the tartness of tomato. The kesari bath is rich, in ghee, toasted cashew, raisins, and also incorporates the fruit of the season, and the spicy tinge of cloves.

"MY LAST MEAL At KOSHY‚ÄôS BENGALURU | Fish Biryani, Kerala Prawn, Tomato Cheese Toast, Mutton Omelette",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-trm02ZdIFI,"#koshys #bangalore #popularrestaurant 

popular bangalore restaurant, bengaluru, koshys cafe, koshys bakery, jewel box, popular breakfast in bangalore, popular lunch, coffee shop, bakery, all day breakfast, mutton omelette, tomato cheese toast, fish biryani, kerala prawn fry, chilli chicken, plum cake, coffee

Most of my visits to Bengaluru‚Äôs iconic Koshy‚Äôs, an eatery that dates back to pre-independence times, have almost always been for their all-day breakfast. Simple omelettes, comforting toasts made with wholesome bread from their bakery, old-fashioned cutlets and sandwiches, the sort that can brighten up a dull day. In this episode, filmed just before they closed doors owing to the current crisis, I partake of a couple of their breakfast must-haves, their crowd-pleasing fish biriyani and a prawn fry that pays ode to the establishment‚Äôs Keralan roots, and also take a look at how they tried their their best to keep serving customers in these trying times. I hope this landmark cafe, an indelible part of the city‚Äôs history, emerges stronger in due course. Take care and stay safe.

Do catch our previous Koshy‚Äôs episode for an in-depth look at their history and the must-have breakfast dishes here:
KOSHY‚ÄôS BEST BREAKFAST DISHES| Mutton Cutlet, Appam Stew, English Brekkie... Exclusive KITCHEN TOUR https://youtu.be/YCMp44D6jak

Tomato Cheese Toast
This dish celebrates the sweet tartness and textures of tomato - crisp dices, sauteed near pulpy bits and thick sauce slathered over thick toast of Koshy‚Äôs homemade bread. Shavings of cheese round off the flavours with savoury notes. 
Rs. 170 (usd 2.3) 
8/10

Mutton Omelette
Food doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated, but the sort where it touches your soul. Like this simple omelette, beaten egg rolled around mutton mince that seasoned sparingly, sings the flavor of the meat. Savoured with some toast and butter, this is the breakfast of Koshy‚Äôs champions!
Rs. 240 (usd 3.2) 
8/10

Chilli Chicken
Koshy‚Äôs version of this Sino-Indian staple that one will only find in India is generous in the peppers and onions, but lacking in some chilli punch one would expect. I also wish the sauce had permeated the chicken better. 
Rs. 360 (usd 4.8) 
6/10

Fish Biriyani
This fish biriyani has been on Koshy‚Äôs menu for decades and is the sort that requires one to redefine the notions of a biryani. Composed of plump steaks of kingfish, fried, cooked in a gravy and then topped with basmati rice, it isn‚Äôt one for the biryani purist, but certainly makes an impression on the palate.
Rs. 430 (usd 5.8) 
7/10

Kerala Prawn Fry
A delicious preparation of tiny fried chemmeen, prawns. One can taste the sweetness of the prawns juxtaposed against the toasty herbaceousness of the curry leaves, the singe of pepper, the lilt of coriander and other spices.
Rs. 500 (usd 6.7) 
9/10

Plum Cake
Koshy‚Äôs plum cake has legions of fans not just in Bengaluru and the country but across the world. The fruits are macerated, rendering a slightly bitter edge against the sweetness and subtle spicing of this plum cake that is not as heady and alcohol-laced as some traditional cakes can be. It makes for the perfect sweet close to a meal here with some coffee.
Rs. 40 (usd 0.5) 
9/10

Koshy‚Äôs Special Coffee
Rs. 52 (usd 0.7)

Exploring Bengaluru‚Äôs Timeless IYENGAR BAKERY Tradition At 60-Year-Old Sri Jayalakshmi Bakery,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftOa3FsNU-Y,"#iyengarbakery #traditionalbakery #bangalore 

popular bakery, traditional bakery, bengaluru, iyengar bakery, benne biscuit, vegetable puff, egg puff, aloo bun congress, khara bun, bun butter jam, dilpasand, honey cake, almond biscuit, salt biscuit, khara biscuit

The Iyengar Bakery is an integral part of Bengaluru‚Äôs culinary landscape. Located in almost every neighbourhood of the city, these traditional bakeries date back to the turn of the last century when two Iyengar brothers from the Ashtagrama (a cluster of eight villages) area in Hassan made their way to Bengaluru in search of livelihoods, and built on the legacy of British bakeries with their own customs and flavours. Over the years, more from the community followed in their footsteps, a trend exacerbated by the famine of the 50s which rendered agriculture in the villages unviable, leading to the rapid growth of Iyengar bakeries in Bengaluru, Mysuru and elsewhere in the South.  In this episode, I visit Sri Jayalakshmi Bakery, a 60-year old bakery that though rooted in its traditions has made space to evolve with the times. Needless to say, I also taste many of the calorie-laden but deliciously addictive goodies that have built for these time-honoured establishments a loyal fan following over the years. Hope you enjoy this one, stay safe and happy eating!

Benne (butter) Biscuit
The sort of cookie that‚Äôs crumbly, fragile and almost melts in the mouth. 
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) per 100 gm 
8/10

Vegetable Puff
Bite into the airy crunch of layers of pastry that traps within its folds a flavourful vegetable stuffing. A popular snack anytime of the day. 
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 
8/10

Egg Puff
One you get past the airy crunch of the pastry layers, you taste the creamy egg bhurji that's fortified with half a boiled egg. Reason why these outsell the vegetable puff in a traditionally vegetarian establishment.
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 
9/10

Khara Bun
A generous hit of curry leaf and green chilli in a spice mix stains this popular bun a yellowish green and also gives it a spicy bite. The savoury notes of toasted onions and a smidgen of sugar rounds off the flavours on the palate.
Rs. 15 (usd 0.2) 
9/10

Aloo Bun Congress
Picture a soft bun stuffed with a creamy, lightly tempered potato mash. Slice it open and slather on a generous helping of spiced peanuts. That‚Äôs the ABC for you. Soft and creamy with the toasty, spicy crunch of peanuts, delicious down to the last bite.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) 
9/10

Bun Butter Jam
A sweet, raisin speckled bun sandwich slathered with salted butter and Sri Jayalakshmi‚Äôs homemade mixed fruit jam, on the palate it evokes memories of a comforting bread, butter jam sandwich packed in a school snack box.
Rs. 32 (usd 0.4) 
8/10

Dilpasand
Sri Jayalakshmi Bakery‚Äôs most popular sweet offering is the sort of calorie-laden indulgence that helps you get past a bad day, if you are having one.Puff pastry stuffed with freshly grated coconut, raisins, glazed cherries, tutti frutti, cashew nuts and scented with cardamom! Sweet Bliss!
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 
10/10

Honey Cake
Another one for the sweet tooth, a butter sponge cake dipped in a sugary syrup and rolled over in desiccated coconut. The sweetness, though is cut, thankfully, by the acidity of the jam that‚Äôs smeared on top.
Rs. 25 (usd 0.3) 
7/10

Almond Biscuit
The sort that breaks off in a crisp, soft, crunch.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) per 100 gm 
8/10

Salt Biscuit
Initially, you taste almost nothing, but then you are surprised by its salty spike that makes a late appearance on the palate. 
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) per 100 gm 
8/10

Khara Biscuit
Flavours of the khara bun - curry leaf, chillies, onions and jeera - but in a biscuit form.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) per 100 gm 
8/10

Making The Nellore-Style ANDHRA BIRYANI At Most Popular NANDHANA PALACE | Tasting 13 Iconic Dishes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmPT_LY2Y0Q,"#nandhanapalace #andhracuisine #bangalore

andhra cuisine, meal, andhra biryani, nellore biryani, nandhana palace, bangalore‚Äôs largest andhra restaurant chain, sholay kebab, drumstick soup, mutton bone soup, chilli chicken, chicken kshatriya, chicken amravati, nellore mutton biryani, mati kodi biryani, chicken biryani

In good times or bad, Bengaluru loves its biryani and the one biryani that is perhaps most favoured here is the Andhra biryani. A biryani that‚Äôs nuanced in its depth of flavour and finds its roots in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, I catch the making of this traditional biryani from start to finish at the newest outpost of Bengaluru‚Äôs largest chain of Andhra restaurants, Nandhana Palace. In doing so, I chat with second generation owner, Shweta Ravi, and learn of her family‚Äôs commitment to culinary traditions over three decades, and also savour the many creations of the kitchens here that are now synonymous with Andhra cuisine. Hope you enjoy this one. Stay safe and happy eating!


Drumstick Soup
Made of drumstick marrow and leaves, this is a soup that‚Äôs warming and rich in nutrients.
Rs. 95 (usd 1.3) 
8/10

Mutton Bone Soup
Mutton bones simmered over hours into a spicy broth, served with a tender piece of meat that offers a juicy bite of this soup. 
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6) 
9/10

Carrot 65
There‚Äôs little in the flavour of the reddish-orange batter-fried discs tossed in garlic, curry leaves and spices that reveals it‚Äôs made of carrots! If you are a vegetarian looking to savour the flavour of the legendary chicken 65, this Nandhana Palace invention is perhaps the closest you can get.
Rs. 185 (usd 2.5) 
8/10

Sholay Kebab
This invention of the kitchens at Nandhana Palace is now synonymous with fried chicken Andhra style. Marinated in a yoghurt and spice masala and deep-fried, the result is a kebab that‚Äôs moist to the core and seriously addictive.
Rs. 270 (usd 3.6) 
9/10

Chilli Chicken
The chicken is coated in a sauce of naati (local) green chillies that packs a ferocious, palate-numbing punch. If you have a high tolerance for chilli heat, do pop a few of the whole chillies floating in the dish to derive the painful yet satisfying pleasure of indulging in the Andhra chilli chicken. 
Rs. 240 (usd 3.2) 
8/10

Chicken Kshatriya
This dish is an ode to the family‚Äôs Kshatriya lineage. Stained bright yellow with turmeric, the fresh flavours of the masala hold to the chicken leg, making for a flavourful bite. A touch of cashew nut also renders a rich note to the sauce alongside the pungency of garlic. 
Rs. 270 (usd 3.6) 
9/10

Amravati Chicken
Boneless morsels of chicken cooked in a semi-gravy rich in the savoury flavours of fried onions, curry leaves and hint of fennel. 
Rs. 280 (usd 3.7) 
8/10

Mutton Pepper Fry
The meat is cooked to pink tenderness and its flavour reigns supreme beyond the pepper-rich masala. The cooks at Nandhana Palace certainly know how to treat the meat right. 
Rs. 290 (usd 3.9) 
9/10

Bamboo Chicken
A tribal dish that finds its provenance in the Araku valley of Andhra Pradesh, it features chicken that‚Äôs marinated in green and red chillies, ginger, garlic and other fresh ingredients, and then poached in its juices in a sealed bamboo cross section over fire.  
Rs. 299 (usd 4) 
8/10

Nellore Mutton Biryani
Layers of flavour from the spices - cloves, cinnamon, marat moggu, bayleaf, etc., waft through your palate when you place a morsel of the basmati rice in your mouth. You can also taste the underlying sweet acidity of the pineapple, a unique ingredient of the Nellore biryani. The meat has a bit of a bite, and is flavourful. 
Rs. 290 (usd 3.9) 
10/10

Nati Kodi Biryani
Made with short-grained seeraga samba rice, the nati kodi biryani takes over the palate with its spicy, green chilli laden flavours laced with the freshness of coriander and mint, and the toasty savouriness of fried onions. The rice when tasted on its own has a salty edge which complements the feisty character of the country chicken. 
Rs. 270 (usd 3.6) 
8.5/10

In keeping with the need of the hour to minimise contact, Mavalli Tiffin Rooms iconic lunch which hitherto involved an unending procession of dishes doled out of buckets and salvers, is now confined within a ‚Äòlimited thaali‚Äô that is by no means limiting on the appetite! The number of dishes may have been scaled back, but the satisfaction one derives from tasting their homestyle Karnataka vegetarian fare hasn't diminished in the least. And when here, one can‚Äôt let go of an opportunity to taste their legendary masala dose and their addictive coffee. Learn how Bengaluru‚Äôs oldest standing restaurant is adapting to life in the new normal! Stay safe and happy eating!

Masala Dose
One can never tire of a masala dose here. Drenched in ghee, crisp to a brown roast, encasing a smear of chutney and the gatti (firm) aloo gadde palya, it‚Äôs the sort of dose that sings to your palate. 
Rs. 95 (usd 1.3) 
10/10

Limited Meals
It‚Äôs name belies its enormous proportions! On the thaali sit a couple of hot pooris accompanied with a potato saagu and a dry palya (vegetable preparation); one can also opt for the masala dose instead of the poori. And then, there‚Äôs the crowd-pleasing bisi bele bath, rich in its lentil goodness, chase this with more rice, soaked up in the sambar and rasam. And to wrap things up, a couple of desserts, a simple nuchinna goddi (broken wheat) payasam and a plump sugar-soaked gulab jamun. If you prefer to not succumb to the calling of a post-prandial siesta, order for their seriously addictive coffee.
Rs. 190 (usd 2.5)

"LAST LUNCH At EBONY, Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular Multi-Cuisine Restaurant | Arcot Chops, Butter Chicken",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UYt2-MNY5o,"#ebony #bangalore #multicuisine

popular bangalore restaurant, bengaluru, ebony, 13th floor, asean on the edge, popular multicuisine restaurant, popular lunch, pan indian, asian, arcot lamb chop, kakori kebab, thai crisp vegetables, nonya prawns, dal makhni, butter chicken, diwani handi

My first meal in Bengaluru when I moved here 25 years ago was at Ebony, a restaurant perched on the 13th floor of one of the city‚Äôs earliest highrises. Dining under the stars, I distinctly remember the food, a smattering of Parsi, Pan Indian and Continental, dished up, simply minus any pretence yet solid in its flavours, much like the character of the city I now call home. I learnt later that the restaurant came into being quite by accident, born out of a crisis after its owner, Rajesh Rajaram, having bought the property as an investment was unable to flip it owing to the adverse fall out of the first Gulf war. Over the years, Ebony has successfully weathered many crises, evolving multiple avatars, the city‚Äôs most ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô bar and more recently, an Asian restaurant. But sadly, the economic brunt of the current situation seems to have gotten the better of this Bengaluru bellwether. I visit Ebony for their last lunch service as they close shop to emerge stronger in a couple of months. Take care and stay safe. Happy eating!

Do catch our wine tasting table at Ebony here:
A Tasting Of Indian Wines From SULA & KRSMA|TASTING TABLE|Pairing Food & Wine|White Wines For Summer  https://youtu.be/p7TDogoQWok

Nonya Crunchy Butter Prawns
Despite being crumbed in a flavoursome buttery crunch that resonates the toasty herbaceousness of crispened curry leaves and the tingling heat of red chillies, the faint sweetness of the prawns shines through. 
Rs. 495 (usd 6.6) 
8.5/10

Thai Crispy Vegetables
Vegetables served up in a crispy batter with a honey-chilli combination, this was a vegetarian favourite at 13th Floor. The peppery notes of basil accents this appetiser.
Rs. 355 (usd 4.7) 
8/10

Salonee Broccoli
Moistened in a saffron-mustard marinade, the grilled broccoli florets unburden the punchy mustard flavours on the palate. The processed cheese rounds off flavours of this tasty appetiser. 
Rs. 320 (usd 4.3) 
8/10

Arcot Mutton Chops
A ghee laden lamb chop that is slow-cooked to juicy doneness, and then charred on a grill to form a delicious masala crust. A traditional Mudaliar dish, the ghee in this heroes the juicy bite of the meat. A must-have when at Ebony. 
Rs. 545 (usd 7.3) 
10/10

Kakori Kebab
Tender, rich in fat, lamb mince that is massaged with gentle spices and grilled on a skewer, these fragile kebabs leave a warming smokey, decadent impression as they melt away when placed in the mouth.
Rs. 525 (usd 6.7) 
9/10

Ebony‚Äôs Ultimate Butter Chicken
Rich in the tart sweetness of the tomatoes that cradles the tandoori spiced, grilled chicken, this is a dish that is supposedly a popular order here. I would have enjoyed a bit more kasoori methi punch in this makhan-laden dish. Having said that, it‚Äôs a dish that is comforting with a hot roti.
Rs. 495 (usd 6.7) 
8/10

Hyderabadi Deewan E Handi
Vegetables cooked in a rich cashew and onion gravy, the softened shallots add a punch of demure sweetness. 
Rs. 385 (usd 6.7) 
8/10

Malaidar Dal Makhni
Loved the smokey, buttery flavours of the dal makhni that has been cooked slowly allowing for the flavours to develop. This is a dal that I would happily return for. 
Rs. 325 (usd 6.7) 
9/10

TKS IYENGAR‚ÄôS | No Staff But This Family Isn‚Äôt Giving Up Serving DELICIOUS HOMESTYLE IYENGAR FARE!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVCOuARcyj4,"#IyengarFood #Vegetarian #Bangalore

TKS Iyengar‚Äôs, a passion enterprise spanning three generations of a family came as a breath of fresh air to Bengaluru's tiffin culture with time honoured recipes that were hitherto confined to homes. Not surprisingly, this charming refreshment house became an instant hit when they opened doors a year ago. However, the current covid situation has brought all that to nought, and left the family with no staff and barely any business to make ends meet. However, rather than buckle down, the ladies of the house aided by their menfolk are doing all that it takes to keep their traditions alive, from manning the stoves to serving customers to keeping house. I savour a delicious homestyle Iyengar meal on a recent visit, and while doing so said a silent prayer, hoping that eateries like TKS Iyengar‚Äôs survive these turbulent times. For if not, we would be much poorer in losing the rich, ancient culinary traditions of our land. Take care and stay safe.

"Karnataka Style Maratha Cuisine At MARATHA DARSHAN | Mutton Korma, Raagi Mudde, Kheema Unde, Chicken",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nuv7VPYrH8c,"#MarataDarshan #NonVegetarian #MarathaCuisine

popular non vegetarian lunch, maratha cuisine, marata darshan, military hotels, bengaluru, bangalore popular lunch spot, mutton korma, chilli chicken, ragi, raagi mudde, kheema unde, mince ball, curry, mutton liver fry, chicken biryani

Maratha warriors entered Karnataka over a couple of centuries ago, drawn to battle, but were eventually disarmed by the people, customs and traditions of the land. And so they stayed back integrating into the local community, adopting culinary practices along the way. And thus was born Karnataka style Maratha fare, distinctly different from that found in the neighbouring state. I revisit Marata Darshan, a family-run eatery that though immensely popular today had rather humble beginnings on a pushcart nearly 30 years ago. Hope you enjoy this episode, take care and stay safe. Happy eating.

Do catch our previous Marata Darshan episode for an in-depth look at the kitchen, meet the family, and savour many other dishes:
MARATHA STYLE NON-VEGETARIAN Food | MARATA DARSHAN | Naati Koli Saaru, Mutton Chops & More! https://youtu.be/WF5Yb2q-0VA

Kheema Unde
These mutton mince roundels, floating in a spicy broth are soft to the touch and on the palate exude only the flavour of meat punctuated with spices. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.6) 
9/10

Chilli Chicken
The Maratha version, rich in tomatoes, green chilli and pepper; the chicken is moist and juicy, cooked perfectly down to the bone.
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
9/10

Mutton Liver Fry
The liver has bite but is still creamy, any gaminess is offset by the flavours of the pepper that the liver is roasted in. It makes for a delicious meal with the thin chapatis served here. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.6) 
8.5/10

Mutton Korma
Meat that is swathed in a generous amount of fat, the meat is cooked long until soft and tender. Barring the initial bite, it breaks down in the mouth instantly. The rice and korma are the perfect match, the rice doing well to absorb the deep unctuous flavours of the curry.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.6) 
10/10

Chicken Biryani
A local Karnataka style biryani, the rice is moist and redolent with the flavour of mint and coriander, the meat peels away from the bone and exudes a smokey aroma. It‚Äôs the sort of biryani that works well when you taste the rice and meat together, add some if you need a spicier punch.
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)

"AIRLINES HOTEL | Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular Outdoor Eatery | Butter Masala Dosa, Mangalore Buns & More",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8UWMD97V2E,"#AirlinesHotel #ButterMasalaDosa #DriveInRestaurant

bengaluru, bangalore popular breakfast, drive-in restaurant, garden restaurant, pure vegetarian, south indian, mangalore buns, sambar vada, medu vada, butter masala dosa, dose, akki rotti, channa bhatura, south indian snack, sambar, chutney, kesari bath, basundi, lavelle road, state bank of india road, coffee 

Named simply for the reason that an airline office was located down the road when it first opened its doors as Bengaluru‚Äôs first drive-in restaurant in 1968, Airlines Hotel harks back to a time when life was uncomplicated. As evident in its non-pretentious South Canara fare headlined by the wafer-crisp butter masala dose, that has won it legions of fans over the years, served under the magnificent verdant canopy of ancient banyan trees. Some may say the restaurant is a relic of the past, but then life has a way of coming full circle, the restaurant‚Äôs garden eating providing a much-needed social-distanced setting with the bonus of Bengaluru‚Äôs glorious outdoorsy weather. Enjoy this video. Stay safe and happy eating!

Mangalore Buns
A puffed deep-fried pastry made of maida dough that‚Äôs fortified with ripe banana, yoghurt, cumin seeds, and left to ferment. The bun is a tad chewy, the banana making its presence felt on the palate and also aiding in its subtle sweetness.
Rs. 65 (usd 0.9) 
8/10

Sambar Vada
The sort of vada that one should perhaps be tasting with steaming hot idlis if one is looking for a substantial snack. The vada isn‚Äôt crisp, but then that makes it of the perfect sponge to soak up the delicious Airlines Hotel sambar!
Rs. 65 (usd 0.9) 
7/10

Butter Masala Dosa
Loaded with butter and the resulting calories, the dose is crackling crisp and ironically a hit with Bangaloreans for whom savouring this is a ritual after an early morning walk or jog in nearby Cubbon Park! But then, to be fair this certainly a dose that can make anyone weak. Lined with a red chutney and bearing a potato stuffing that also employs the crunch of carrots and beans, this is a dose you will love if you like it crisp. 
Rs. 130 (usd 1.7) 
9/10

Akki Rotti
The akki rotti is crisp around the edges and a tad dry on the bite. However, this filling snack is redeemed by the moistness of the gentle coconut-urugadle chutney, to take the spice quotient a few notches higher, taste it with the pungent byadgi chilli-garlic chutney. 
Rs. 115 (usd 1.5) 
7/10

Channa Bhatura
A popular lunch order, this isn't your typical NorthIndian style dark-coloured and deep-flavoured chole. Get over that and you will be rewarded by a tasty combination of the chickpea with a steaming hot bhatura.
Rs. 155 (usd 2.05) 
7.5/10

Kesari Bath
Not a lush ghee-laden version of a popular Bengaluru tiffin, the version here is rich in pineapple flavours. 
Rs. 90 (usd 1.2) 
7/10

Basundi
If you enjoy dairy-richness, you will dig the lushness of this dessert, milk thickened in a pan slowly and then fortified with nuts, cardamom powder and served chilled. 
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6) 
8/10

Coffee

"Full-On ANDHRA NON-VEG Meal At BHEEMA‚ÄôS | Biryani, Mutton Pepper Fry, Guntur Chicken, Chilli Chicken",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VxcFHRSDEI,"#Bheemas #AndhraFood #Bangalore

andhra cuisine, bheema‚Äôs, bengaluru, non vegetarian meal, lunch, fish fry, chilli chicken, mutton pepper fry, guntur chicken, mutton seeraga samba biryani, chicken biryani, nellore biryani, popular bengaluru lunch spot

After many a vegetarian reviews over the last few weeks, I was craving the comfort of some hearty non vegetarian fare. And so we landed at Bheema‚Äôs to savour a spicy Andhra bhojanam of fish fry, chilli chicken, mutton pepper fry, Guntur chicken, and a couple of biryanis, their staple Nellore version in addition to their ode to Bengaluru‚Äôs dhonne style biryani! And needless to say, we also took a quick look behind the scenes to see how this popular restaurant is gearing up to serve customers in these challenging times. Enjoy and stay safe. 

Fish Fry 
A tasty fry, though not the sort that will blow your socks off! It‚Äôs a thin slice of fish, napped in a sprightly masala and fried crisp around the edges.
Rs. 370 (usd 4.9) 
7/10

Chilli Chicken
No Andhra non-vegetarian meal can be complete without a chilli chicken, rich in copious amounts of green chilli and pepper. The spice hit is tongue-numbing, but one that‚Äôs vicariously addictive. The chicken is nice and juicy all the way down to the bone. 
Rs. 270 (usd 3.6) 
8/10

Mutton Pepper Fry 
The mutton is soft and yields to a gentle bite, draped in a pepper-onion masala. The meat is sheathed in some fat, which lends it its fulsome flavour. At Bheema‚Äôs they pick their meat cuts well and certainly know how to cook it well too.
Rs. 350 (usd 4.6) 
9/10

Guntur Chicken
A chicken preparation that heroes the Guntur chilli.The creaminess of the coconut though and the acidity of tomatoes in this dish balances against the heat of this otherwise spicy Andhra chilli.
Rs. 305 (usd 4) 
8/10

Mutton Jeera Rice Biryani
Bheema‚Äôs ode to the local Bengaluru biryani, this one is made with the short-grained seeraga samba rice. You can taste the fervour of coriander, mint and green chillies alongside other ingredients like the marat moggu, cloves that are typically used in this one-pot rice and meat preparation. The meat slides off the bone, it is cooked as well as that! 
Rs. 295 (usd 3.9) 
8/10

Chicken Biryani 
Bheema‚Äôs most popular dish, this traditional Nellore-style biryani is made with basmati rice. There‚Äôs flecks of pineapple that go into this biryani and you taste its acidity juxtaposed against the aromatic flavours of cloves, cinnamon and other warming spices that the chicken and rice are cooked in. The meat is soft and juicy, however it is the delicate spicing of the biryani that makes an impression on the palate and lingers long after one has finished eating.
Rs. 260 (usd 3.4)

South Bengaluru‚Äôs popular vegetarian restaurant, Maiyas prides itself on serving the ‚Äúpurest, cleanest and tastiest food‚Äù, says 72 year-old Sadananda Maiya whose family has a legacy in food for nearly a century beginning with Mavalli Tiffin Rooms in 1924. And given his erstwhile venture, MTR Foods, it‚Äôs not entirely surprising to even find a food lab on the premises of his restaurant which merges the culinary traditions of South India with food science and technology. In this episode, I take in a quick tour of Maiyas, and also its crowd pleasing special vegetarian thali. Hope you enjoy this episode. Stay safe and happy eating! 

Special Meals
This thali has everything you need for a satisfying, nourishing meal. First on the plate are hot, puffy puris, sans any residual oil, that goes well with a creamy potato saagu, a crunchy kosambari and palya (dry vegetable preparation). Next troops in a flavourful pulao, followed by anna (rice), sambar and rasam with a sweet payasam thrown in. Best to linger over this meal, nice and slow.

"Savouring Our FIRST CRISP MASALA DOSA In The New Normal | VIDYARTHI BHAVAN, BANGALORE | Rava Vada...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap9nhsJEsLQ,"#VidyarthiBhavan #MasalaDosa #Bengaluru

bengaluru breakfast, bangalore popular breakfast, south indian breakfast, evening tiffin, vidyarthi bhavan, basavangudi, south bengaluru, popular bangalore dosa, masala dosa, masala dose, uppitu, rava vada, kesari bath, coffee 

There‚Äôs nothing that comes close to savouring the crisp crackle of a dosa a few moments after it has left the pan. An experience that we missed much in lockdown. And so when Bengaluru‚Äôs most popular dose spot, Vidyarthi Bhavan re-opened dine-in, we lost no time in getting there to savour their iconic masala dose, scrumptious rave vade and a couple of other evening treats. In doing so, I also took a look at the measures that this eatery has employed to ensure a safe dining experience. Enjoy and stay safe. 

Rave Vade
A deep-fried semolina vade studded with chilli, cashewnuts, ginger and curry leaves and served only in the evening, I am told this is quite popular. It‚Äôs bite is as crunchy as a cookie, crisp around the edges and soft towards the centre. 
Rs. 27 (usd 0.35) 
8/10

Kesari Bath
A textbook kesari bath that dissolves on the palate in a buttery gush of ghee, the raisins convey a pop of sweetness and the cashew lends a toastiness to the clove-induced flavour of this semolina pudding. 
Rs. 27 (usd 0.35) 
8/10

Uppitu
The flavour of onions headlines this soft semolina preparation that‚Äôs studded with fried lentils, green chillies and curry leaves. A flavoursome dish on its own, savour it with the spicy chutney if you prefer to perk things up. 
Rs. 27 (usd 0.35) 
8/10

Masala Dose
If you need one reason to visit Vidyarthji Bhavan, this would be it. A dose that‚Äôs crisp and lacey in parts, soft and fluffy in others, and hides within its single fold a creamy potato palya. The chutney is spicy and vivacious, a bold complement to the gentle flavours of the dose and palya.

I step into The Oberoi, Bengaluru, for my first dine-in meal post lockdown, where I not only savour some of the signature specialities at Lapis, the all-day dining restaurant here, but more importantly, take a close look at the measures being employed by the hotel to ensure safety of guests and staff in these precarious times. From sanitisation of guests, their vehicles and belongings, to meticulous back of the house and kitchen processes aimed at fostering heightened levels of hygiene, to restaurant modifications that appear to not just take care of social distancing, but also airflow management, the team here seems to have made good use of the lockdown to ready services for the new normal. Hope you enjoy this episode, folks. Stay safe and happy eating!

BruleÃÅe Of Goat Cheese And Herbs
This dainty bruleÃÅe of goat cheese, crested with a passion fruit vinaigrette and basil seeds, is lusciously creamy with a smokey edge and contrasts sharply with the pickled beetroots served on the plate. The pistachio granola chip provides sweet relief to complement the fat and acidity of the dish.
Rs. 775 (usd 10.2) 
8.5/10
         
Inside-out Karari Roomali Roti
A conversation starter of a dish, the humble roomali roti is roasted on a ulta tawa until crisp and slathered with a heavy hand of spiced butter. The trio of yoghurts, a puckeringly tart kairi (raw mango), beetroot and a savoury masala dip, served alongside elevates the status of the roti from being a mere nibble to that of a palate-teaser. 
Rs. 625 (usd 8.2) 
7/10
    
    
   
 
Hyderabadi Lamb Keema Tikki
A kacche kheeme (raw mince) ki tikki, the charred crust of which yields to the juiciness of the meat and the fresh crunch of onions on the bite. The flavours hark to a Hyderabadi pathar ka gosht, a possible inspiration behind the spices in this delicious lamb appetiser. 
Rs. 1025 (usd 13.5) 
9/10
 
Peri Peri Cauliflower Deep Dish Pizza
A perfectly executed Chicago style deep dish pizza, the pie is crunchy at the base and that helps hold within itself its weighty stuffing of peri peri spiced cauliflower, jalapeno and cheese. 
Rs. 1395 (usd 18.3) 
10/10

Organic Kale And Ragi Millet Soup
There‚Äôs a nutty bitterness to this soup, the sort that tastes healthy. Not a soup that‚Äôs designed to pander to your taste buds, the rajira (amaranth) and millet help in adding a touch of texture.  
Rs. 495 (usd 6.5) 
7/10

Pan Seared Kolkata Bekti
The sea bass is cooked to the perfect, crisp sear yet moist inside. The wilted spinach works well as a foil to the sweetness of the mild Creole sauce with its slightly bitter, savoury notes.
Rs. 495 (usd 6.5) 
9/10

Karnataka Lasooni Panchkuta Saag
Five varieties of greens go into the making of this saag that‚Äôs topped with roasted garlic and a generous dollop of white butter. 
Rs. 995 (usd 13.1)

The Unbelievable Apple
This striking dessert layers apple jelly, cinnamon mousse and spiced, stewed apple core into a clever take on the apple crumble.

In this throwback video, I share with you a meal that I savoured in the home of Mrs Jayanti in the tiny fishing hamlet of Kovalam, Tamil Nadu. I tasted a Prawns Thokku, Para Kozhambu, and even a dried fish, Karuvadu, that tides the community through times when fish is not easily available. Hope you enjoy this short and sweet episode.

"LOCAL Military Style OOTA Takeaway| ROYANNA MILITARY CANTEEN| Khaali Palav, Chicken Kebab Mutton Fry",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCEzWIyB_Z8,"#RoyannaMilitaryCanteen #Bangalore #NonVegetarianLunch 

Takeaway Meal, Lockdown, Royanna Military Canteen, Karnataka Meal, Military Style Food, Chicken Kebab, Chicken Liver Fry, Mutton Fry, Curry Leaf Chicken, Chicken Pepper Fry, Chicken Pulav, Mutton Pulav, Pulav, Pulao, Non Veg Meals, Bangalore, Bengaluru

Just over a year old, Royanna Military Canteen seeks inspiration from the decades-old traditions of military hotels in the South, in its meaty menu that serves up naati (local) dishes. But in a format that the restaurant says is ‚Äúsanitised and one that makes military-style fare convenient to families eating out.‚Äù The important question, though, does the food deliver the tasty punch that one has come to expect of military hotels that have stood the test of time? Well, I visit the restaurant and grab a takeaway of most of their dishes to find my answer. Hope you enjoy this episode. Take care and stay safe.

Chicken Kebab
Not as crispy as a kebab would be when tasted at the restaurant, but the chicken is moist, juicy and flavourful. The chicken is cooked perfectly and peels off the bone. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
8/10

Curry Leaf Chicken
The rich masala exudes the toasty herbaceousness of curry leaf, however its flavours have not penetrated the meat as one would have desired. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.6) 
6.5/10

Chicken Pepper Fry
The chicken is moist and napped in a flavourful masala rich in onions, tomatoes, coriander and curry leaf. The onions have been roasted to a deep brown. Definitely a dish to savour at Royanna.
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
8.5/10

Mutton Fry
The meat has a bit of a bite, after all one is eating local, military-style dishes. The buttery, unctuous flavour of the fat that straddles the meat makes for a lush mouthfeel. The spicing is gentle and warming as opposed to the fiery chilli hit one sometimes encounters when dining local style. 
Rs. 280 (usd 3.7) 
8.5/10

Chicken Liver Fry
The chicken is perfectly cooked to a creamy texture, its deep flavours complemented by the pepper laced green masala. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2) 
9/10

Palav
Cooked with chicken, but served minus the meat, the khaali palav is a spicy, military hotel tradition. The palav here though is mild on the palate, if you like to pick up the flavours, combine it with the sherva, the spicy broth that‚Äôs served with the palav.
Rs. 120 (usd 1.6) 
7/10

Chicken Palav
If you are looking for a bold, military-style pulav, this is not it. But if you‚Äôre looking for something mellow in flavour, this would be a good pulav to taste. The chicken benefits when tasted with the rice, the latter lending its spice notes. The pulav comes alive when combined with the spicy sherva.
Rs. 160 (usd 2.1)
8/10

Mutton Palav
The palav is deeper in its flavours helped by the character of the red meat and also the fat that‚Äôs clinging on to it. One needs to work though, to pry some meat from the bone, and also to chew on it. One of those rare occasions when I preferred the chicken palav to mutton. 
Rs. 180 (usd 2.4)
7/10

"A Taste of Dindigul in Bangalore | DINDIGUL THALAPPAKATTI BIRYANI Making | Mutton, Chicken & More...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_WmEoHb7vA,"#DindigulThalappakatti #Biryani #Bengaluru 

Takeaway Meal, Lockdown, Dindigul Thalappakatti Restaurant, Dindigul Thalappakatti Biryani, Mutton, Chicken, Vegetable, Biryani, Mutton Chukka, Mutton Kuchi, Chicken Kodaikanal, Chicken Peri Peri, Kola Urundai,  Kuzhambu, Biryani, Bangalore, Bengaluru

In the year 1957, Nagasamy Naidu set out to sell a biryani made to his wife‚Äôs unique recipe in the then sleepy town of Dindigul in Tamil Nadu. Seated at the counter, always with a turban tied on his head, led to the eatery being popularly referred to as the Thalappakatti (thalappa - turban; katti - tied) biryani shop as opposed to its original name, Anandha Vilas, and thus was born an establishment that today owns (yes owns, not franchises) nearly 70 outposts of Dindigul Thalappakatti across the world. I visit the kitchen here to watch the cooking of their famed biryani made with small-grained seeraga samba rice, and also visit one of their eight restaurants in Bengaluru to get a takeaway bundle of their signature dishes. Hope you enjoy this episode. Happy eating and stay safe! 

Kola Urundai
Spiced roundels of mutton mince, it‚Äôs unassuming form doesn't reveal the flavourful rush of spices it delivers on the palate. 
Rs. 137 (usd 1.8) 
7.5/10

Mutton Chukka
Tiny morsels of meat, soft and yielding, with a springy bite. You can taste the grainy crunch of the coconut and the pepper hit, the perfect snack to accompany an evening tipple.
Rs. 253 (usd 3.1) 
9/10

Peri Peri Chicken Chops
The smokey, spiciness of the peri peri masala certainly perks things up on the palate alongside a zing of acidity, perhaps from some vinegar. The mayo helps assuage the spicy assault of the peri peri chicken. 
Rs. 300 (usd 4) 
8/10

Kuchi Mutton
Tender goat ribs, braised in a deep-roasted masala. The meat is soft and tender, encased in a thin veil of fat which adds to the flavour. The parotta makes for a handy bread to mop up the masala, this is a dish that epitomises the way in which DT cooks its mutton! A must-have!
Rs. 288 (usd 3.8) 
9/10

Kodaikanal Chicken Kozhambu
The chicken is moist and calming in its flavours, the spicing is mellow and cradled in creamy coconut milk. You bite into flecks of coconut as you savour this kozhambu.
Rs. 265 (usd 3.5) 
8/10

Vegetable Biryani
The seeraga samba rice heroes the Dindigul biryani powder that makes for the masala, the vegetables, beans, carrots and cauliflower, have been roasted in the masala thus imbuing in them the flavour of the biryani.
Rs. 210 (usd 2.8) 
7.5/10

Chicken Biryani
The rice is flavoursome and the chicken definitely benefits when savoured in its company. Taste it with the biryani gravy and its endearing tomato-acidity if you like to moisten things up on the palate. The boiled egg helps stretch the protein component on the plate.
Rs. 240 (usd 3.2) 
8/10

Thalappakatti Boneless Mutton Biryani
This is the biryani that‚Äôs synonymous with Dindigul Thalappakatti, and therefore it is no surprise that they do it extremely well. The seeraga samba has not just trapped the flavour of the spices, but also the smoky aromas of the meat. The meat is soft, tender and moist. This is the sort of deep-flavoured, satisfying biryani that needs no accompaniment, either the gravy or the raitha. A must-order if you‚Äôre a biryani buff.
Rs. 299 (usd 4)

"Make This AUTHENTIC MANGALOREAN FISH CURRY | Spicy Surmai, Pomfret, Rawas, Kane, Prawns Curry RECIPE",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwVRasFxCdE,"#Mangalorean #FishCurry #Recipe

Easy Fish Curry, Mangalorean Fish Curry, Fish Curry Rice, Indian Fish Curry, Seer Fish Curry, Pomfret Curry, Prawn Curry, Mangalore, Seafood, Kudla, Easy Recipe

The Mangalorean fish curry is the perfect balance of spice, heat and sour. In this recipe episode, we cook up a seer fish curry from scratch, including a vivacious masala that lends itself well to any mild-flavoured fish like pomfret, kingfish, ladyfish, or even prawns. Its beautiful bright reddish-orange hue comes from the combination of Kashmiri & Guntur chillies I prefer to use in this traditional preparation from namma Kudla. Traditionally, the curry is prepared atleast a couple of hours ahead of meal time, thereby allowing the fish to soak up the flavoursome masala. Served with steaming hot rice, this is a curry that pleases the soul! Enjoy!

Link to Rooster Masala episode https://youtu.be/3RXHj32sToQ

The Hayagreeva Maddi is said to have been first made in the temple town of Udupi in South Canara as an offering to Lord Hayagreeva, the horse-faced avatar of Lord Vishnu. Since then, this wholesome Madhwa Brahmin dessert, made of Bengal Gram, jaggery and nuts mostly, continues to be offered as prasadam and is relished especially during festivals. Hope you enjoy my recipe adaptation of the Udupi Hayagreeva; I find in this a divinely delicious, nutritious and guilt-free fix to a sudden dessert craving, given that it can be whipped up quite easily at very short notice. Enjoy!

MANGALOREAN PRAWN PULAO | Make This FLAVOURSOME Shrimp Pulao | Coriander Mint Masala | MOM'S RECIPE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsujrx3xu1Q,"#Mangalorean #PrawnPulao #Biryani

The Mangalorean Prawn Pulao is unlike any seafood pulao. At its heart is an aromatic coriander-mint masala that complements the sweetness of fresh shrimps, and lends this rice dish an appealing greenish hue and a unique fulsome flavour. One of my favourite food memories growing up, this was a pulao cooked by my Mom on special occasions like birthdays,  with plenty of medium-sized prawns, thereby ensuring a taste of the crustacean in every mouthful. And she would also find in this pulao the perfect medium to include finely chopped carrots and beans to feed veggies to her fussy kids. ;-) This pulao recipe is truly special to me, I hope you find it special enough to cook too. Take care and stay safe. Enjoy! 

Mangalorean Prawn Pulao
Serves 4

Ingredients:

500 gm medium-sized prawns (roughly around 40 to 50 prawns) 
2 large onions, finely chopped
2 carrots, finely chopped
10 beans, finely chopped
1 cup peas
8 cloves
5 to 6 green cardamoms
1 inch cinnamon
Oil/ ghee to cook
Salt to taste

For the masala
1 big bunch of coriander and stalk,
1 cup of mint leaves 
Ensure coriander and mint are in a 60:40 ratio.
8 to 9 green chillies
1 inch of ginger, peeled and sliced
10 to 12 pods of garlic
1 tsp of turmeric powder
1 tsp salt

Please refer to the video for the method.

"A FISHERMAN‚ÄôS LIFE What It Takes to Bring You Great Catch! Fishing, Beachside SEAFOOD FRY Tamil Nadu",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08V8k7za3lU,"#gourmetontheroad #fishing #tamilnadu

#fisherman #fishing #lifeofafisherman #kovalam #tamilnadu #chennai #fishfry #seafood #seafoodfry #gourmetbiker 

There is much hardship and uncertainty a fisherman endures each day to bring us our favourite harvest of the sea. In this video from our earliest culinary explorations, we travelled to the tiny fishing village of Kovalam in Tamil Nadu to spend a day with Selvam. We took a boat ride into the ocean where this sunburnt fisherman shared with us a moving account of what it takes to carry on with the traditions of his community. On our return, we stopped at his favourite stall to taste some seafood fries. Hope you find this episode an interesting watch, and take a moment to remember not just the fishing community but the many growers and producers who must face enormous difficulties to bring to us the food that nourishes and sustains us, especially in these unforeseen times. Stay safe.

"Make The Parsi Delicacy, AKURI | Best ANDA SUBZI | Spiced SCRAMBLED EGGS | ORIGINAL Mumbai Recipe",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkEeWTSkZiU,"#Eggs #ScrambledEggs #EasyRecipe  

Akuri, Parsi Scrambled Eggs, Spicy Scrambled Eggs, Desi Eggs, Parsi Dish, Parsi Cuisine, Irani Restaurant Breakfast, Breakfast. Eggs, Eggs Recipe, Easy Recipe, Parsi Sambar Masala, Authentic Recipe, Mumbai, Parsi Dish, Bombay

In this lockdown recipe episode, we celebrate the humble ‚Äòanda‚Äô in the making of an Akuri, the spicy Parsi version of scrambled eggs. Some confuse this dish with the Mumbai street food staple, ‚Äòanda bhurji‚Äô, but the Parsi Akuri is a different dish altogether, from its nuanced spice notes, its depth of flavour, and its texture, comparable to a savoury custard. Growing up in Mumbai, this was a dish I would savour in Irani restaurants with some kadak brun pav, or in Parsi homes. I dig deep into my food memories to cook this comforting ‚Äòeggy‚Äô dish, perfect for breakfast or a lazy lunch. Enjoy, stay safe and happy cooking.

Ingredients

Serves 2

3 eggs
1 tbsp ghee, you could use refined oil as well.
Knob of cold butter butter for finishing
2 medium sized onions, chopped finely (roughly ¬Ω onion per egg) 
2 medium sized tomatoes, chopped finely (roughly ¬Ω tomato per egg)
4 to 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 to 3 green chillies, finely chopped
¬æ 1 tsp red chilli powder
¬Ω tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp Parsi sambar masala (optional) The Parsi sambar masala is that special touch that adds depth of flavour to the dish. It is a concoction of chilli powder, turmeric, asafoetida, fenugreek seeds, mustard seeds, peppercorn, star anise, cloves and cinnamon, ground together, and then combined with heated sesame oil). If you don‚Äôt have this, you can use any garam masala to add flavour depth.
2 to 3 tbsp coriander, chopped
Salt to taste

Make Super Delicious KUNDAPUR GHEE ROAST At Home | Authentic CHICKEN/ PRAWN/ VEG Ghee Roast Recipe,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHyaXqs6Og,"#Kundapur #Chicken #GheeRoast  

Ghee Roast, Chicken Ghee Roast, Prawn Ghee Roast, Veg Ghee Roast, Recipe, Shetty Lunch Home, Mangalore, Kundapur, Authentic Recipe, Karnataka, Ghee, Chilli, Chicken, Kundapur Masala, Kundapur Ghee Roast, Kundapur Chicken Ghee Roast, Ghee Roast Mangalorean Style, Ghee Roast Kundapur Style

One of my all-time favourite comfort foods is the Kundapur Ghee Roast. A dish born decades ago in a tiny eatery called Shetty Lunch Home in the then sleepy hamlet of Kundapur along the South Canara coastline. Over the years, this spicy preparation has conquered palates across the country and beyond. What gives this dish its soul is the roasted Kundapur Masala, that manifests itself in the spicy, tangy, robust flavours of this preparation. Over the years, I have tasted many ghee roasts and watched its making in illustrious kitchens, including Shetty Lunch Home. This recipe, my ode to the dish and its creators, is versatile enough to be made not only with chicken, the original chicken ghee roast, but also with prawns, paneer or any veggie of your choice. Enjoy, stay safe and happy cooking.

1 kg chicken or prawn or vegetable of your choice

For the marinade:
4 to 5 tbsp yoghurt
1 to 1 ¬Ω tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp chilli powder
1 to 2 tsp salt (to taste)
1 tsp lemon juice/ vinegar

For the Kundapur Masala
8 dried Guntur chillies
10 dried Byadgi chillies
2 Tsp peppercorns
1 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp mustard seeds
1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
2 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tbsp thick tamarind pulp 
16 - 20 garlic cloves
Water as required

To cook:
6 to 8 tbsp ghee 
20-30 nos curry leaves
Salt as required

I had heard much of Behrouz Biryani, or rather had consumed many of its slick ads touting a mythical kingdom and the story of a 2000-year-old recipe! So when the craving to indulge in some biryani in this lockdown hit me real hard, I decided to order in and put this ‚Äòstoried‚Äô biryani to the test. Did the biryani live up to the tale, or was its advertised appeal as mythical as its story? Well, you will have to watch the video to find out. Enjoy and stay safe, folks!

#gourmetontheroad #gotrraw #athome #foodloverstv 

Subz-e-Biryani
The vegetables consisted of peas, carrots, potatoes and cauliflowers, mushy for the most part, and slathered in a rich masala. The rice though was cooked perfectly, each grain blossomed to its fullest. Rs. 286 (usd 3.7) 
6/10

Lazeez Bhuna Murg Biryani
With tonnes of masala, this isn't a biryani that will endear itself if you‚Äôre looking for something delicate. The rice is cooked well, garnished with slivers of almonds, but suspiciously tastes just like the rice in the vegetable biryani. The chicken is firm, not juicy and succulent.
Rs. 314 (usd 4.1)
5/10

Dum Gosht Biryani
With three or five juicy pieces of meat slathered in masala, this is a biryani that could feed two. The meat is soft and moist, cooked perfectly. Taste with plenty of mint raita to wash down the warmth of the spices in the masala. 
Rs. 448 (usd 5.9)
7/10


We ordered for these biryanis on a delivery app. Our total bill came up to Rs. 1098 including taxes.

Hi folks, a few days ago, I ordered a Pothichoru, a Kerala packed lunch, for those not in the know, Pothi = Bundle and Choru = Rice. This rice bundle  tradition, I am told, is the lunch lifeline in Kerala, where every morning the ladies of the house pack rice with the day‚Äôs curries, vegetables, fries, sides and pickles into warmed banana leaf parcels for family members to carry to homes, schools and offices. Here‚Äôs my experience of tasting a Pothichoru in Bengaluru. 
Enjoy!

An ayurvedic potion of fresh turmeric, ginger, and a host of other spices and ingredients that you can easily brew at home. The recipe comes from my wife's grandfather who was an Ayurvedic practitioner in Thanjavur. A potent immunity booster, rich in antioxidants and known to ward off a host of ailments, including respiratory such as common cold, sore throat, alleviate morning allergies, etc., this brew is a part of my daily diet now. Hope you find it useful too.

75 gm fresh ginger

5 to 7 cinnamon sticks
3 to 4 tsp jaggery (optional)

"Best TANDOORI CRAB, BOMBIL (BOMBAY DUCK) FRY, FISH CURRY & More At GAJALEE Seafood Restaurant MUMBAI",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF5kxbWylmE,"#BestSeafood #Mumbai #GourmetOnTheRoad

Gajalee, Mumbai‚Äôs Favourite, Most Popular Seafood Restaurant, Best Bombay Duck Mumbai, Best Seafood Mumbai, Most Popular Seafood Mumbai, Best Tandoori Crab Mumbai, Best Seafood Restaurant In Mumbai Stuffed Bombil Fry, Bombil Fry, Bombay Duck Fry, Randoori Crab, Indian Salmon Rawas Curry, Fresh Seafood, Bombay, Seafood, Lunch, Dinner

Gajalee is perhaps Mumbai‚Äôs most popular seafood destination. When here, its fresh seafood offerings, from the signature stuffed bombil fry, prawns koliwada, plain bombil fry, rawas curry to the splurge worthy tandoori crab are a ritual for many of its regulars. I make the most of a quick visit to Mumbai to catch an indulgent seafood feast here and film this GOTR Raw episode. Enjoy!

PRAWNS KOLIWADA
These sea prawns are fresh, well seasoned and encrusted in a crunch rice flour batter. Smother it with the ginger garlic chutney if you like it spicy.
Rs. 425 (USD 5.6)
8.5/10

STUFFED BOMBIL FRY
If you were to try only one dish at Gajalee, this would be it. The delicate, watery bombay duck is rolled around a spicy shrimp mixture, dipped in a batter and fried. The fish retains its moistness despite being fried and the shrimp adds flavour.
Rs. 400 (USD 5.3)
10/10

Bombil Fry
The Bombay Duck is simply seasoned, dredged through a rice batter and fried. Yet another dish to try here. You can quite literally taste the ocean in this preparation.
Rs. 325 (USD 4.3)
9/10

TANDOORI CRAB
It‚Äôs a bit of a splurge, but you definitely get the ‚Äòmeatiest‚Äô bang for your buck! The crab was fresh and plump in its meat. I was worried that the tandoori masala would overpower the flavour of the crab, but that wasn‚Äôt the case. You could taste the sweetness in the flesh, and the gentle edge of the tandoori marinade.  
Rs. 2957 (USD 39)for a one kilo crab
10/10

Rawas Curry
A creamy Malwan style curry, flavoured with the sour twang of kokum. The rawas or Indian salmon was soft and had absorbed the flavour of the curry. Best eaten with the ghavne, lacy pancakes made with a runny rice batter. 
Rs. 425 (USD 5.7)

"HYGIENIC, TASTY & AFFORDABLE! Tiffin At TAAZA THINDI | Most Popular SOUTH INDIAN SNACK Destination",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yIYi4pRZm8,"#VegetarianBreakfast #Bangalore #GourmetOnTheRoad

Taaza Thindi, must-visit for its tasty south indian tiffin, hygienically prepared and affordable! Vegetarian, Masala Dosa, Plain Dose, Masala Dose, Plain Dose, Idli, Vada, Khara Baath, Kesari Baath, Chowchow Baath, Coffee, Filter Coffee, Bengaluru, Bangalore, Jayanagar, Breakfast in Bngalore

Tasty food made using quality ingredients in a kitchen that rivals the best in terms of its hygiene standards and at prices that make it affordable for everyone, these are three tenets religiously adhered to by Taaza Thindi, that have made it one of Bengaluru‚Äôs most popular South Indian tiffin destinations in a short span of only six years in a culinary landscape that‚Äôs dominated by institutions that have been around for decades. 

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna savours a delicious tiffin comprising of all five dishes on the menu here, but not before a detailed walk-through of this eatery that has no door separating the restaurant from the kitchen in its belief that customers should be able to see how their food is prepared. Enjoy!

Idli Vada
The idli is grainy and porous in texture allowing for the ‚Äòrunny‚Äô chutney to seep through and imbue it with its spicy fervour. The vada exudes a near ‚Äòbiscuity‚Äô crunch and is simple and clean in its flavours. 
Rs. 10 (usd) per idli/ vada
8.5/10

Chowchow baath
Made with bansi wheat rava, the khara baath is porridge-like in its consistency. On the palate, it exudes savoury, spicy flavours tinged with the tartness of tomato. The kesari bath is rich, in ghee, toasted cashew, raisins, and also incorporates the fruit of the season, and the spicy tinge of cloves.
Rs. 25 (usd)
8.5/10

 
Plain Dose
The dose here is not kadak (extremely crisp) but exudes a whisper of a crunch and is soft inside. Although the ghee and oil is quite evident on the fingers, its compact size renders it manageable. The dose seeks the company of the coconut chutney.
Rs. 20 (usd) 
8/10

Masala Dose 
Its golden brown crust glistens with the ghee that‚Äôs ladled over, the kempu chutney reveals itself from within. Crunch (well, almost) into this dose to taste the savoury onion flavour in the creamy potato palya, the warm tinge of of the kempu chutney. 
Rs. 25

Coffee
The perfect close to a tiffin here!

"Juicy LAHM (Mutton) MANDI, 14-Dish PRAWN CURRY MEAL, KERALA | WHITE HOUSE RESTAURANT Wayanad",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TBOTakJdh8,"#PopularHighwayRestaurants #Wayanad #GourmetOnTheRoad

Restaurants On Wayanad - Calicut Road. Popular Restaurants In Wayanad. White House Restaurant. Making Of Mutton Mandi. Pidi Kozhi Porichatu. White House Restaurant Wayanad Road, Puduppadi, Kozhikode Road

Although a relatively recent eatery, White House Restaurant located in Puduppadi has turned into a dining hotspot for travellers on the Wayanad-Kozhikode route. Lured by its enticing offerings that include traditional Keralan dishes cooked on wood-fired stoves and much loved Arabian dishes like the Mandi, prepared in deep rubber wood-fired brick pits, we had to stop here for a meal enroute to Kozhikode. 

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna relishes a 14-dish Prawn Curry Meal, a juicy Pidi Kozhi Porichathu, the Mutton Mandi of course, and a Ayakora or King Fish Fry.

TAWA FISH 
The kingfish has been cocooned in a masala with coconut milk as its base and hence the spicicing is quite gentle in its warmth. I like the crunch of the coconut flakes in the masala. 
Rs. 300 (usd 4.2)
8/10

PRAWN CURRY MEALS 
I was expecting a bowl of prawn curry and rice, but instead it came in a procession of 14 dishes packed into tiny bowls. The prawns were fresh and cooked with the head, which is where the flavour pop is! A nice touch were the drumsticks in the curry. Also enjoyed the crunch of the beans poriyal, the bitter gourd, the fish pickle and the red chilli chutney with a touch of sweetness. The paruppu payasam is the perfect end to the meal here.
Rs. 140 (usd 2)
10/10

PIDHI KOZHI PORICHATHU
A juicy bird despite its scrawny size, and served with a mutta (egg). The fried curry leaves makes for a toasty relish. One of the signature dishes here, loved the crunch of the masala that this chicken is covered in before being deep fried. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.8)
9/10

MUTTON MANDI 
cooked the traditional way in a brick-lined pit oven. The meat peels away effortlessly from the bone with a thin flavourful veil of fat. The rice is scented with the meat juices and hit of saffron. The mandi is served with a smattering of chutneys, but I preferred savouring the delicate flavours of the dish sans any condiment. 
Rs. 550 (usd 7.7)

"Unusual SALEM IDLI, ONION DOSE | DOSE MANJANNA, A Son‚Äôs Tribute, Father‚Äôs 48-Year Street Cart Legacy",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCkVRP1tsuE,"#Bangalore #IdliDosa #GourmetOnTheRoad

Dose Manjanna, Must Try Salem Idli, Butter Idli, Onion Open Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa, Jayanagar, Bengaluru, Vegetarian, Street Food


Manjanna ran a popular street cart for 48 years in the South Bengaluru suburb of Jayanagar selling only three or four dishes, dose, idli and vada, earning him the moniker, Dose Manjanna. His son, Ganesh, seeks to keep alive his late father‚Äôs legacy in a tiny shop, aptly named Dose Manjanna, serving a smattering of traditional and some accidentally inspired creations, like the buttery, spicy Salem Idli. Concocted on a cold, rainy night, when his store had run out of hot idlis, in a bid to acquiesce to a customer‚Äôs demand for hot food just prior to the latter‚Äôs boarding a bus for Salem. 

In this #gourmetontheroad episode, Food Lovers‚Äô editor, Kripal Amanna tastes the Salem Idli, a scrumptious ghee onion dose and a couple of other tiffin treats that has Jayanagar‚Äôs denizens crowding this eatery at all times. Hope you enjoy this episode.

SALEM IDLI
This Idli roasted in butter, sings the flavour of the butter with the spicy, grainy crunch of the podi. Eat it piping hot, just off the tawa. When it cools down, pair it with the spicy hurigadale (fried gram) chutney.
Rs. 20 (usd 0.3)
8.5/10

Butter Idli 
Thatte idli roasted on a hot tawa over melted butter, with lashings of butter and served with a dollop of butter, this is sheer decadence. The idli loses some its fervour as it begins to cool, and that‚Äôs when you taste its slight tartness.
Rs. 20 (usd 0.3)
8/10

Open Onion Dose
Served folded, this crisp, kadak dose was the highlight for me. Dripping with ghee and butter, smeared with chutney podi, a generous sprinkling of moist, crunchy onions, this dose is flavourful enough to be eaten on its own. The chutneys served alongside play a distant second fiddle to this open onion dose. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
9/10

Mysore Masale Dose
The masale is smeared into a paste with chutney podi, butter and onions as the dose is roasted on the tava. I expected it to be robust in its flavours, however the potatoes seem to tone down the aggression of the chutney podi, making this a gently-spiced bite. Mix together the gram chutney, chutney podi and butter that‚Äôs served alongside, and combine with the dose to savour a spicy mouthful. 
Rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
8/10

Shavige Baath 
The shavige baath here is light, fluffy and springy, tossed in a chitranna or lemon rice masala. Studded liberally with peanuts, fried lentils, flecks of green chilli and roasted curry leaves, it makes a gentle yet persuasive impression on the palate. If you like it spicy, enjoy it with the smokey tomato-red chilli-roasted gram chutney.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4)

"TASTY VEGETARIAN TWIST | Parmesan KHICHDI, Avocado PAPDI, HALWA Mousse, Coffee MALAI| STREET STORYSS",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAQ_IXUDNTo,"#Vegetarian #Bangalore #GourmetOnTheRoad

Street Storyss, Vegetarian Street Food With A Twist, Vegetarian Restaurant in Bengaluru, Bangalore, Indiranagar, World Cuisine, Indian Cuisine, Burmese Cuisine, Asian Cuisine, Tibetan Cuisine, Italian Cuisine,  Chef Nishant Choubey
 
Street Storyss caters to the discerning vegetarian palate with its playful adaptations of ‚Äòstreet flavours‚Äô from the world. Chef Nishant Choubey, curator of the cuisine here says they seek to take popular fare and add a unique dimension that elevates the original dish.

Intrigued, Food Lovers‚Äô editor, Kripal Amanna, takes up the chef‚Äôs invitation to visit this popular eatery in Indiranagar, Bengaluru, and taste a smorgasbord of creations - Rajma Ghee Khichdi, Tibetan Laping Roll, Soba Khow Suey, Mushroom Salad, Thai Corn Cake, Coconut Pancakes... some a delightful confluence of flavours and textures, some rather unexpected, but all vegetarian! Enjoy!

Avocado Mousse
A papdi with Western aspirations, the desi yoghurt makes way for the creamy avocado mousse. The chutneys are replaced by piquant raw mango salsa and a refreshing tomato salsa.
Rs. 295 (usd 4.1)
8/10

Curried Cauliflower & Beetroot Soup
A vegan offering at Street Storyss, the warming spiced cauliflower broth combines with the sweet and sour beetroot puree in a lively jig on the palate. 
Price na
8.5/10

Pomegranate Kombucha 
A refreshing mocktail of fermented kombucha and fresh pomegranate.
Rs. 250 (usd 3.5)
7/10

Tibetan Laping Roll
These translucent noodle rolls deliver batons of pickled cucumber and watermelon in a chilled sweet and sour crunch, swathed with the nuttiness of sesame soy and the warming heat of ginger. 
Rs. 325 (usd 4.5)
9/10

Thai Corn Cake
Corn pureed and coaxed into a cake before being cubed and fried. The result is a lush, creamy appetiser, topped with toasted garlic and chilli. 
Rs. 325 (usd 4.5)
8.5/10

Bangkok Stir Fry 
This is a dish that seems atypical for an eggplant preparation. Bite into its deep-fried crunchy texture to savour its soft and mushy insides. Tossed in a chilli garlic sauce, this is certainly a dish that‚Äôs made for the spice-loving palate.
Rs. 325 (usd 4.5)
9/10

Warm Mushroom Salad
A dish with banging umami flavours, the shiitake has been poached with aromats rendering it soft and gentle on the bite. The cooked watermelon provides a fruity contrast to the star anise scented notes of the mushrooms.
Rs. 395 (usd 5.5)
9/10

Burmese Khow Suey
Soba noodles, placed atop a creamy yellow curry that‚Äôs rich in coconut flavour and the fragrant notes of fresh turmeric.  
Rs. 425 (usd 5.9)
8.5/10

Nasi Goreng
The black bean lends its fermented salty punch to the Nasi Goreng, but I found the preparation a tad dry and unappealing.
Rs. 325 (usd 4.5)
6/10

Rajma Ghee Khichdi
Far removed from the humble khichdi, this version is topped with crunchy khakra and slivers of parmesan. 
Rs. 425 (usd 5.9)
8/10

Coconut Pancake with Besan Halwa Mousse
Inspired by the Bengali patishapta, the pancakes are topped with a near-cloyingly sweet besan halwa mousse. The pancakes help rein in some of the sweetness, the banana chips help in this effort too.
Rs. 325 (usd 4.5)
8/10


Frozen Coffee Malai
This is the dessert to try if you like a milky dessert and coffee. Smooth in its consistency, its flavour harks back to a cardamom-scented kulfi or rabri, condensed milk.
Rs. 295 (usd 4.1)

"CTR - SHRI SAGAR | Bangalore‚Äôs Most Popular BENNE MASALA DOSA, GOLI BAJJI, IDLI & More | Malleswaram",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ylb6ISVUxLY,"#Vegetarian #CTR #GourmetOnTheRoad

Central Tiffin Room, CTR Malleswaram, Shri Sagar, Bangalore‚Äôs Most Famous Benne Masala Dose, Goli Bajji, Mangalore Bajji, Kesari Bath, Masala Dosa, Maddur Vade, Rava Idli, Ordinary Masala Dosa, Filter Coffee

When it comes to the Benne Masala Dosa, all roads lead to CTR - Shri Sagar or Central Tiffin Room in Bengaluru. The city‚Äôs love for this butter drenched dose goes back a few decades when the present owners took charge of this 70-year old establishment that served as the only eatery in the historic Malleswaram area.

Food Lovers‚Äô editor, Kripal Amanna catches up with Sandesh Pujari, third generation owner of this landmark eatery and explores what makes the benne dose special, before indulging in a tiffin treat that includes not just their most loved offering, but other equally popular snacks like the Mangalore bajji, Maddur Vade and more. Enjoy!

Rava Idli
The soft rava idli makes for a wholesome, comforting tiffin, bathe it in the kai (coconut) chutney or savour it with the vegetable sagu that is packed with nutrition and flavour.
Rs. 29 (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

Goli Bajji
Scrumptious with a bit of a stretchy pull on the bite, and served steaming hot, the goli bajji is a must-have when you are at CTR for an evening snack. Relish it just by itself, with its slight hint of sweetness, or dunk it into the chutney to make for a spirited mouthful.
Rs. 35 (usd 0.5)
9/10

Maddur Vade
This vade has the texture of a scrumptiously flakey cookie. On the palate, one tastes the deep savoury notes of the fried onion. Relish it while at CTR, or also carry some home, it makes for a great snack on the go
Rs. 29 (usd 0.4)
8/10

Ordinary Masala Dosa 
The dose is roasted kadak (crisp), and smeared with a generous amount of kempu (red) coconut chutney inside that lends a tinge of heat. The creamy masale, potato palya, barely whispers its flavours, but lends a great supporting act to the dose that takes centerstage with every bite.
Rs. 52 (usd 0.7)
8.5/10

Benne Masala Dosa
This butter-drenched gold-hued dose is blessed with the perfect gentle crackle. On the palate, one tastes the lushness of the homemade butter that envelopes every bite of the dose, the palya and the chutney with its delicious veil. If you need one reason to visit CTR, this would be it.
Rs. 57 (usd 0.8)
10/10

Kesari Bath 
Dripping in ghee and topped with toasted cashews and raisins, the grainy kesari bath almost melts away when placed in the mouth. The cashew provides an element of nuttiness and the raisin, pops of sweetness to this semolina preparation.
Rs. 29 (usd 0.4)
9/10

Coffee 
A fitting end to a meal here.

"Tasting HOT & SPICY DARJEELING STYLE MOMOS | Chicken, Paneer, Vegetarian | STEAMED, FRIED & SZECHUAN",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFfRmfqffHI,"#Momos #StreetFood #GourmetOnTheRoad

Hot Momos, Unique Momos, Darjeeling Style, Indian Street Food, Bengaluru, Bangalore, Steamed Dumplings, Steamed Vegetable Momo, Steamed Paneer Mom, Steamed Chicken Momo, Fried Chicken Momos, Fried Chicken Momos in Szechuan Sauce, Street Food, Momos, Bengaluru Street Food, Veg Momos, Veg Momos Indian Style, Veg Momo Recipe, Chicken Momo, Fried 

This tiny dim sum shop serves momos with a difference, says its owner, Dawa Lepcha, a migrant from Darjeeling into Bengaluru, ‚Äúthey are steamed fresh with the filling raw, which makes them juicier than other momos.‚Äù I put his claim to the test as I taste an assortment of momos - steamed, fried and sauced, spicy, in this snacky Gourmet On The Road outing. Enjoy! 

Steamed Vegetable Momo
Stuffed with a cabbage, carrot, bean and capsicum filling that‚Äôs enlivened with a ginger-garlic and green chilli paste, this is a savoury momo, quite flavourful for a veggie option.  If you like it spicy, go for the chilli sauce. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8) for 8 pieces
7.5/10

Steamed Paneer Momo
I was quite cynical of this momo before I tasted it. But one bite and I changed my mind! If I were a vegetarian, I would be quite happy with this momo stuffed with soft paneer and slivers of green chilli. Flavourful enough to be eaten on its own minus the chutney.
Rs. 70 (usd 1) for 8 pieces
7.5/10

Steamed Chicken Momo
The chicken momo had spent a bit longer in the steamer than necessary, and therefore weak in the strength of the dumpling wrap. The chicken stuffing is the consistency of a soft paste, and though flavourful, a bit shy in asserting itself on the palate. I wish this momo was served hot though.
Rs. 70 (usd 1) for 8 pieces
7/10

Fried Chicken Momos
These deep-fried momos are crispy and crunchy outside and doughy inside. An interesting contrast of textures that makes for an interesting bite. Though I wasn‚Äôt a fan of its chatpata taste with the chaat masala that‚Äôs sprinkled quite liberally on the momo..
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1) for 8 pieces
7/10

Fried Chicken Momos in Szechuan Sauce
The Szechuan style spicy momo tops the ‚Äòfiery‚Äô chart here and is certainly not for the faint-hearted. All that you taste here is tonnes of chilli spice, the momo ends up being just a dumpling that has surrendered to the assault of the spicy sauce.
Rs. 100 (usd 1.4) for 8 pieces

"Spicy KONGUNADU VILLAGE STYLE Tamil Food | KOTHANUR KITCHEN Bangalore |MUTTON URUNDAI, NETHLI KURUMA",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVvv-Xgx68c,"#TamilCuisine #NonVegetarian #GourmetOnTheRoad

Kothanur Kitchen, Authentic Kongunadu Cuisine, Tamil Cuisine, Village Style Salem Food, Kothanur, Bengaluru, Bangalore, Kothu Parotta, Mutton Kola Urundai, Egg Boti Fry, Naatu Kozhi Fry, Nethili Kuzhambu, Naati Kozhi Kuruma, Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani, Non Vegetarian 

This village style eatery in the North Bengaluru suburbs of Kothanur draws inspiration from Kongunadu cuisine and the streets of Salem in its hearty non vegetarian Tamil fare. Kothanur Kitchen favours cooking over wood fire and a strict no-refrigeration policy, ensuring that everything that is served is cooked with fresh ingredients for the day. 

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor visits the restaurant to savour some of the most popular dishes served here, from a Mutton Kola Urundai to Egg Boti Fry, a vivacious Netholi Curry and more. Enjoy! 

Kothu Parotta
Robust in its spicing, this parotta that has soaked up the egg masala and chicken sherva will transport you to the street stalls of Salem. 
Rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
8/10

Mutton Kola Urundai
Love the texture of these spiced mutton mince balls, it's got a bit of a crunch as you bite into it but is yielding inside. The meat hasn‚Äôt been ground to a paste, and the spicing is gentle, leaves behind a happy warmth on the palate. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.8)
9/10

Egg Boti Fry 
The boti is prepped and cooked rather well too. There is none of the raw ‚Äòanimal‚Äô scent that one smells if offal meat isn't cleaned well. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)
8/10

Naatu Kozhi Fry 
At first bite, I felt the meat was a bit too tough, although I enjoyed the flavours of the fry - the tartness of the tomato, the mild sweetness of the onions and the savouriness of the Salem masala. However, as you chew on the chicken, it releases the flavours of the masala it has been cooked in. 
Rs. 200 (usd 2.8)
8.5/10

Nethli Kozhambu
This Sunday special fish curry  at Kothanur Kitchen combines the humble nethili fish with the puckeringly sour raw mango in a curry pot that‚Äôs cooked slowly over a wood fire. 
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)
9/10


Naati Kozhi Kuruma 
The chicken is cooked with the skin, which lends a fulsome flavour to the kuruma. The kuruma in itself is rather delicately flavoured, allowing one to savour the flavour of the meat and the lingering warmth of the spices.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.8)
8.5/10

Mutton Kuruma 
The fat flavour in this kuruma is quite pronounced, I also found the meat a tad chewy. On a positive note, the gravy benefits from the richness of the fat on the meat. 
Rs. 180 (usd 2.5)
7/10

Chicken Biryani 
The rice is quite flavourful once you get past its slight stickiness. On the palate you taste the freshness of the mint and coriander, the acidity of the tomatoes amidst the spices.  
Rs. 130 (usd 1.8)
8/10

Mutton Biryani 
The mutton biryani is restrained in its spice notes and spotlights the flavour of the meat. The rice is cooked perfectly in this naati, country style biryani, with the fat lending its deep savoury unctuousness.
Rs. 200 (usd 2.8)
8.5/10

Kalaki 
In case you haven‚Äôt had enough of the meaty preparations here, the custardy goodness of the kalaki, an egg and chicken curry mix that's cooked to the point where the egg begins to coagulate, provides the perfect end to a Kongunadu meal.  
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4)
7.5/10

"Rare BENGALURU ACREY IDLI Served By A 30-year-old FAMILY-RUN Eating House, SSP REFRESHMENTS | Pulav",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APZptWlOEWI,"#VegetarianBreakfast #AuthenticBreakfast #GourmetOnTheRoad

SSP Refreshments, also known as Mudanna Hotel, Mixing Hotel, Jayanagar, Bangalore, serves rare Bangalore Idli, Acrey Idli, Acre idli, Ikrey Idli, Pulav, Vegetable Pulav, Palav, Chitranna, Vada, Uppitu, Mosaru Anna, Vegetarian Breakfast, Bangalore, Breakfast, Idli, Chutney, Mudanna Pulav

With recipes gleaned from his father-in-law, Devaraju and his wife began a small venture out of their home nearly 30 years ago, serving what is now a rare Bangalore breakfast delicacy, the Acrey Idli. Since then, SSP Refreshment House has amassed a formidable reputation for its limited menu, an aromatic vegetable pulav, chitranna and a couple of other dishes, that run out not too long from the time they open doors to their home at 7 am.

Food Lovers‚Äô editor, Kripal Amanna savours some of the dishes and also peeps into the kitchen to chat with the family and catch the making of the now-largely-lost Bengaluru Acrey Idli. Enjoy! 

Acrey Idli 
The idli is soft and unbelievably pliable, melts in the mouth when hot. You can smell the gentle sweet aroma of the batter which is perfectly fermented rendering a springy fluffiness to the idli. The thick, spicy lentil chutney with flecks of dry coconut makes for a great accompaniment.
Rs. 20 (usd 0.3)
9/10

Chitranna 30/ 20
You can taste the gentle tartness of the lemon, the flavour of cumin and pointed notes of green chilli on the palate, the lentils in the seasoning make for a nice bite.
Rs. 20/30 (usd 0.3/ 0.4) for half/ full portion
7/10

Pulav 
A flavourful pulav with the lingering warmth that comes from spices such as cinnamon and cloves, this is what draws customers to SSP. There‚Äôs the spicy kick of green chilli, but juxtaposed against the other ingredients, its hit is not the sort that obliterates your tastebuds. The seasoned chutney served alongside adds a layer of pleasing nuttiness. 
Rs. 20/30 (usd 0.3/0.4) for half/ full portion
8.5/10

Mosaru Anna  
Gentle on the palate, this provides cooling respite if one has overindulged in the spicy pulav and chutney.
Rs. 20/30 (usd 0.3/ 0.4) for half/ full portion
7.5/10

Breakfast at SHIVAJI MILITARY HOTEL | Most Popular CHICKEN DONNE BIRYANI Making Revealed! BANGALORE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qGZEmRWjxU,"#ShivajiMilitaryHotel #DonneBiryani #GourmetOnTheRoad

Bengaluru's most popular Shivaji Military Hotel, Chicken Donne Biryani, Mutton Donne Biryani, Breakfast, Bengaluru's Top Restaurants, Biryani

What begins as a visit by Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna, to check out this iconic restaurant‚Äôs breakfast soon turns into a never-seen-before-on-video demonstration on the making of Bengaluru‚Äôs most famous chicken biryani, the Donne Biryani at Shivaji Military Hotel, a restaurant that has stood tall for over eight decades for its local-influenced Maratha fare.

Needless to say, he also catches a full military-style breakfast that includes a nourishing paaya soup, chicken leg masala, chops, mutton liver, khaali dose and steaming hot donne biryani. 

Lunch at Shivaji Military Hotel video - https://youtu.be/XxatALJz0Ro

Leg Soup
The gelatine has rendered well into the broth and glistens on the surface, you taste the flavour of the fat in the broth and the spicing too, especially the green chilli. The trotter is the sort that melts in your mouth. 
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2) for 2 legs.
8.5/10

Chicken Chops 
A rich, spicy green masala of coriander, mint and onions, studded with green peas. The juicy chicken pieces tame the salty savoury punch of the gravy. The khali dose makes for the perfect companion to taste the chicken chops masala. 
Rs. 190 (usd 2.6)
9/10

Chicken Leg Piece
Plump chicken legs cooked nice and juicy down to the bone. Definitely not a dish for the faint-hearted, you can taste the searing heat of the red chilli powder in this gravy. The onions,  tomatoes and lime provide a mildly sweet-tart counterpoint to the chilli heat though. 
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2) for 2 pieces.
8.5/10

Mutton Liver 
The mutton liver is cooked to perfection in a green masala, has a springy bite and is soft and creamy inside. Absolutely delicious, the intense earthiness of the liver goes well with the salty savouriness of the gravy.
Rs. 150 (usd 2.1)
10/10

Mutton Dry
The fat bits in the meat pieces add flavour. I tasted this piping hot off the stove, but I wish the meat had rested in the masala for a bit post cooking for me to better savour this peppery preparation. 
Rs. 190 (usd 2.6)
8/10

Chicken Donne Biryani 
You can taste the ingredients that have gone into Shivaji Military Hotel‚Äôs iconic donne biryani the moment you place the intensely flavourful rice in your mouth. The sweetness of the spices, the star anise, the mild astringency of the cloves, the fresh bite of the herbs, the pointed pungency from the green chillies, the tartness of tomato and the lime. The ghee coats the rice with a film of lushness, you can smell the smokiness from the dum. The chicken is delicate in its flavour, and not as effusive. Savour it with the rice to enjoy the complete range of flavours in this dish. 
Rs. 190 (usd 2.6)
9/10

"Bangalore‚Äôs ‚ÄòOldest‚Äô SEAFOOD Spot, HOTEL FISHLAND | KONKANI, MANGALOREAN Fish, Prawn FRY, Crab CURRY",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW7HRFTiDcI,"#Seafood #Bengaluru #GourmetOnTheRoad

Hotel Fishland, 38-year-old seafood restaurant in Bengaluru, specialising in Konkani and South Canara coastal cuisine. Opened in 1982. hotel fishland, gandhinagar, bengaluru, fishland bangalore, fishland gandhinagar bangalore, seafood thaali, seafood thali, special seafood thaali, banged fry, mackerel fry, kana curry, ladyfish curry, prawns fry, crab curry, denji curry, clams, marvai sukka, mangalorean cuisine, konkani cuisine, saraswat cuisine

Established in 1982, Hotel Fishland in Gandhinagar, Bengaluru is one of the city‚Äôs oldest dining spots to cater to a seafood craving. Specialising in Konkani and coastal Mangalorean cuisine, the most popular item here is the seafood thaali.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits revisits this establishment and savours not just the special ‚Äòlimited‚Äô seafood thaali, but a host of other delicacies like the crab curry, bangude (mackerel) fry and prawns masala amongst others. Enjoy!

Special Limited Fish Thaali 
This thaali, complete with a fish curry, fish fry, vegetable of the day, rice, buttermilk and yoghurt had the potential to be a rather satisfying fish meal, especially given the fulsome flavours of the kaane curry. However, it was let down by the kingfish fry that although swathed in a spirited masala and crumb-fried, wasn't the epitome of freshness. Next time, I would order either a fish curry or the limited thaali that arrives minus the fry, but offers terrific value at at Rs. 180, and a fish fry separately.
Rs. 320 (usd 5.3)
7/10

Bangude Fry 
This is what a fish fry should be all about. The mackerel was fresh, plump and juicy. Fried such that the masala formed a thick crust. You can taste the heat of the chilli and the tang of the tamarind in the masala, this combination of spicy and sour made for the perfect complement to the oily flavours of the mackerel. 
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2)
10/10

Prawns Fry
You can taste the sweetness of the sea prawns notwithstanding the robust masala. The prawns are fresh, springy to the bite and the masala coating this crustacean is fried to a delightful crust. Order these for sure.
Rs. 295 (usd 4.1)
9/10

Marvai Sukka 
The clams are wanting in their flavour. All that you taste is the masala, the clams barely make their presence felt. 
Rs. 160 (usd 2.2)
6/10

Crab Masala 
The crab is delicious, plump with briny-sweet flavoured flesh. Chew on the crab shell unabashedly to lap up every ounce of its goodness that also carries the flavour of the curry. The curry too has tones of the crab ‚Äòsweetness‚Äô. Another winner here at Fishland.
Rs. 275 (usd 3.8)

"Exploring BANGALORE‚ÄôS  Tasty AVAREBELE FESTIVAL| VV PURAM FOOD STREET |Avarebele Vada, Dosa, Jilebi!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxTaQDRJpSQ,"#AvarebeleMela #Bengaluru #GourmetOnTheRoad

Bengaluru‚Äôs Annual Avarebele Mela at Sri Vasavi Vaisistha THindi, VV Puram Food Street, Farm to Food, Hyacinth Beans, Hithkabele Masala Vade, Hithkabele Bonda, Avarebele Dose - Hithkabele Saru, Hithkabele Akki Rotti, Avarebele Mosaru Kodubale, Hithkabele Holige, Hithkabele Honey Jalebi, Payasa, Ellavare, Street Food

Now in its 20th year, Bengaluru‚Äôs annual Avarebele Mela that celebrates the Bengaluru bean in an array of ‚Äòsnacky‚Äô preparations, goes back to a time when farmers from in and around Bengaluru would congregate in VV Puram to sell their harvest of Avarekai. Given the bean‚Äôs short shelf life, any unsold produce would be thrown away. Which prompted Mrs Geetha Shivakumar, owner of Sri Vasavi Vasisitha Mane Thindi to put together a food festival that would make use of the Avarebele. And thus began a unique collaboration between farmers and a food entrepreneur that now has Bangalore‚Äôs food lovers congregating here for their share of deliciousness.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor visits the mela and tasted a delicious smorgasbord of preparations, from vade to bonda to dose to hollige to rotti to jalebi to payasa to pootharekulu, with one ingredient in common, the avarebele. Enjoy!

Hithkabele Masala Vade
A top draw at the mela, and also all year around, one can taste the freshness of coriander and dill in this spicy hithabele masala vade. 
Rs. 20 (usd 0.3) for 2 nos.
9/10

Hithkabele Bonda
A tad mellow in flavour, the bonda benefits from the weight of the avarekalu. It‚Äôs a pleasing snack, but fails to make as impactful an impression on the palate as the masala vade. 
Rs. 20 (usd  0.3) for 2 nos.
7/10

Avarebele Dose - Hithkabele Saru
The most popular item at the mela, this dosa is topped with a spirited mix of avarebele, coriander, dil and onions. 
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
9.5/10

Hithkabele Akki Rotti
The akki roti is toasted nice and thin, and crispened around the edges making for a delightful crunch. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8.5/10

Avarebele Mosaru Kodubale
Crisp and crunchy on the bite, but chewy as you linger on this bangle-shaped jeera and ajwain flavoured treat made of steamed rice flour, yoghurt and avarebele.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) for 4 nos.
8/10

Hithkabele Holige
Dripping with ghee and stuffed with tuvar dal, jaggery and hithkabele, one can taste the lingering aroma of cardamom on the palate. 
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

Hithkabele Honey Jalebi
The jalebi are a light pista green in colour from the avarebele which lends its strength to the fermented batter and renders the jalebis cripier and also lends it a tart edge.  
Rs. 20 (usd 0.3) for 4 nos.
8.5/10

Payasa
The avarebele payasa is smokey in its flavour. Although made with gas gase, poppy seeds, one does not taste the nuttiness of the ingredient. 
Rs. 30 (usd 0.3)
6.5/10

Ellavare
Sesame seeds, coconut milk, avarebele and jaggery come together in this thick dessert. I quite enjoyed the crunch of the fresh coconut and the earthy sweetness of the jaggery.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.3)
7/10

Putharekulu
The avarebele makes its way into the putharekulu as well. However, I‚Äôm tasting more of the wrap in this version as compared to the filling and that takes away from the enjoyment of what is otherwise an interesting sweet.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.3)

TKS Iyengar‚Äôs must-visit for authentic Iyengar dishes. Three Generations Family Recipes, Vegetarian, No Garlic, Unique Homestyle Dishes, bale elle idli, thatte idli, classic idli, nuchinna unde, puliyogare, ottu shavige, god halubai, hayagreeva, sweet pongal, bangalore, breakfast

This recent entrant to Bengaluru‚Äôs vegetarian dining landscape located in the suburb of Basaveshwaranagar serves up Iyengar homestyle fare. Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits this eatery for a late breakfast where he tastes an array of dishes, some hitherto unseen in restaurants, such as the Nuchinna Unde, Halubai, Hayagreeva (originally prepared as a temple offering), Ottu Shavige and more. He also meets the three generations of the TKS Iyengar family that is seeking to share its interesting culinary traditions with the people of Bengaluru though this endearing enterprise. Enjoy!

Bale Elle Idli 
The Bale Elle Idli carries with it the subtle aroma of the banana leaf in which it is steamed. The leaf also imbues the idli with a light colouring. You bite into the crunch of coconut and the lentils as you taste the idli, savour it with the sambar that‚Äôs perfect in its sour-sweet balance and the spirited chutney. Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) for 2 pcs
9/10

Thatte Idli
A deliciously delicate thatte idli, springy like it should be. Acts as the perfect canvas of sorts to soak up the flavours of the chutney and sambar.
Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) for 2 pcs
8.5/10

Classic Idli
Grainy in texture and porous, but pales in comparison to the bale elle and thatte idli served here.
Rs. 12 (usd 0.2)
7/10

Nuchinna Unde
If you need only one reason to visit TKS Iyengar, these steamed dumplings made of four lentil varieties would be it. A traditional Iyengar recipe wouldn‚Äôt use onions, but these are added here due to the wants of running a commercial establishment, which lends it a delightful crunch alongside the lentils. Rs. 30 (usd 0.4) for 2 pcs
10/10

Puliyogare
Cooked and cooled rice, flavoured with spicy tamarind paste and fortified with the crunch of lentils and ground lentils, this is a Iyengar classic with the perfect balance of flavours - touch of sweet that gives into sour and the warmth of  the spices. The puliyogare here is made with red rajamudi rice from Hassan. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
9/10

Ottu Shavige
This sweet and ‚Äòkhaara‚Äô combo is served with ella pudi (a powder made of sesame seeds, peanuts and jaggery) gasgase (poppy seed) payasa and a nutty, spicy chutney, enlivened with mustard oil and red chillies.  
Rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
9/10

Godhi Halubai
Made with puree of wheat, coconut milk and jaggery, this wobbly pudding like dessert magically disappears into sweet ‚Äònothingness‚Äô when you place a piece in your mouth.
Rs. 10 (usd 0.15)
8/10

Hayagreeva 
Taste the creaminess of lentils and the bite of dried coconut and cashew nuts in this decadently sweet dessert that was originally made as an offering to Lord Hayagreeva. 
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8.5/10

Sweet Pongal
The whiff of edible camphor that greets you on the palate disappears quickly into the background, leaving you to relish the milky richness of this rice and lentil dessert.
Rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
8/10

Coffee 
Nice way to end things after an indulgent meal here.
Rs. 10 (usd 0.15)

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers editor, Kripal catches up with second generation owner, Raj Sethia over an indulgent chaat outing where he tastes over 9 of the eatery‚Äôs palate-teasing combinations. If you‚Äôre a chaat lover, this is for you! Enjoy! 

PAANI PURI
Super crunchy puri that holds together the spiced potato and bengal gram mix topped with the sweet, tangy paani, just long enough to unburden the delicious snack in your mouth. A riot of flavours and textures, this Kolkata style paani puri is a must-eat here.
rs. 40 (usd 0.6)
9/10

JHAL MUDI
True to its Kolkata roots, mustard oil is the hero in this concoction of puffed rice, potatoes, onions and peanuts. Served in a paper bag, this is the perfect fast food on the go for chaat lovers.
rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
8/10

ALOO TIKKI CHOLA
The aloo tikki, stuffed with green peas and grated coconut, has a nice crust. Topped with the hot chickpea gravy, this makes for a comforting snack. 
rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
8.5/10

MASALA COLA
A concoction of Indian cola served up with spices, it's the perfect thirst quencher to refresh the palate in between ‚Äòchatpata‚Äô plates of chaat.
rs. 50 (usd 0.7)
7/10

RASAGOOLA CHAAT
A unique creation here, the ‚Äòdissolve-in-the-mouth‚Äô rasagoola chaat appears quite bewildering. But the mild sweetness of the rasagoola seems to work with the sweet and spicy hit of chutneys, yoghurt and the crispy texture of sev. If you want to try something different, this is it.
Rs. 70 (usd 1)
8.5/10

MASALA PURI
Karnataka‚Äôs favourite chaat, I found it to be a bit mellow as compared to the pointed flavours of the other concoctions here. 
rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
7/10

DAHI SAMOSA
The crisp texture and robust flavours of the samosa have been tamed by the yoghurt. There‚Äôs the gentle aroma and flavour of fennel seeds in the samosa. Personally, I like the samosa just by itself.
rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
7/10

SEV PURI
The sev puri here plays ode to Mumbai‚Äôs streetfood with its perfect play of textures and tastes. There‚Äôs the crisp crunch of the papdi, the juicy crunch of onions and the cold creaminess of potatoes. The spicing is just perfect making every bite super-satisfying!
rs. 60 (usd 0.8)
9/10

CHANNA MOTH CHAAT
Made sans any fried ingredients, you need to specify this when you order, the channa moth chaat is a chatpata indulgence for the health conscious. This is what happens when chaat and salad come together.

Rasagoola topped with reduced milk and saffron, this is a rich and indulgent dessert. 
rs. 30 (usd 0.4)

"ULTIMATE Calicut FISH CURRY, PAROTTA & CHICKEN FRY At Local Favourite HOTEL SAGAR | KERALA PRAWN FRY",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWgDuEEO6zo,"#KeralaFood #CalicutFoodTrail #GourmetOnTheRoad 

Hotel Sagar, Calicut‚Äôs famous restaurant for fish curry, spring chicken fry, parotta, irani kebab, prawn dry fry, meen molagathu curry, pidhi kozhi porichathu, chicken biryani

A spot in Calicut that does not require too much of an introduction. Located at Mavoor Road, near the KSRTC Bus Stand, 45-year old Hotel Sagar serves a variety of food items from 6 am till late night at 2 am on all days of the week. So, depending on what you wish to have you can come here at any convenient time of the day. Meals, Parotta and Meen Curry, Pidi kozhi fry, Meen Porichathu, Chicken Biryani available here are an all-time hit among its customers.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna tastes some of the must-haves at this popular Kozhikoden eatery.
 
IRANI KEBAB
this dish is Hotel Sagar‚Äôs ode to the Middle Eastern region. Not a dish I would return for, but a tasty dish nonetheless.
rs. 240 (usd 3.3 )
6.5/10

PRAWN DRY FRY
the prawns are medium-sized and pack flavour. A tad excessive on salt, but nothing that a squeeze of lime can‚Äôt fix. I love the spicy-sweet bite of the prawn and toasty notes of coconut oil in which it has been fried. the sort of dish that will make a prawn lover happy. 
rs. 268 (usd 3.7)
8.5/10

AVOLI FISH FRY
The white pomfret is almost crunchy to the bite, the skin is fried to the perfect crisp and soft inside. If you like the flavour of your fish fry to be robust, eat it with a generous measure of the spicy coconut mix that‚Äôs garnishing the fish. 
rs. 375 (usd 5.2)
8.5/10

PIDI KOZHI PORICHATHU
it's a spring chicken, so there's tiny bones to work around to get to the meat. But once you get to the meat, it‚Äôs moist and delicious, swathed in a zesty coconut mixture. A must have dish at Hotel Sagar.
rs. 190 (usd 2.6 )
9/10

MEEN MOLAGATHU CURRY 
a hugely popular dish here, the fish has soaked up the spicy-sour flavours of the curry to the point where it almost disintegrates in your mouth sans any effort. The curry has a chilli kick that‚Äôs balanced by the acidity that comes from tamarind and tomatoes. The light rice pathiri and the layered parotta, both make for an ideal companion to mop up this tantalisingly tasty fish curry.
rs. 140 (usd 1.9)
10/10

CHICKEN BIRYANI
Kozhikoden style dum biryani made with kaima rice. the flavours in the biryani are well rounded, I definitely taste the prominent notes of cinnamon. The leghorn chicken is cooked to perfection and straddles the flavourful masala. 
rs. 172 (usd 2.4)

This TEA SHOP Serves Up AMAZING Local Flavours With A DELICIOUS TWIST! ADAMINTE CHAYAKKADA Calicut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yoAiP-4HDE,"#KeralaFood #CalicutFoodTrail #GourmetOnTheRoad 

Adaminde Chayakkada, must visit destination for Malabari Food served with a twist, Kidilan Prawns Fry, Kozhi Porichathu, Kallumakaya Nirachathu, Kunzhi Kozhi Nirachathu, Elaneer Chicken, Mapranam Fish Curry, Chatti Choru, Parotta Kizhi, Avil Milk

A relatively new entrant to Kozhikode‚Äôs vibrant food scene, Adaminte Chayakkada or Adam‚Äôs tea shop is the brainchild of investment banker turned restaurateur, Aneez Adam. A self-confessed food lover, Aneez sought to showcase the culinary traditions of his Mappila community but in a format that seemed relevant to current times. And thus was born ACKD, as it is known in local parlance, a tea shop that celebrates quirk in its decor and innovation in some of the fare on the menu, a formula that seems to have helped position it firmly on Kozhikode‚Äôs dining map.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits Adaminte Chayakkada to chat with Aneez Adam and also taste some signatures on the menu, both traditional and dishes served up with the ACKD spin.

KIDILAN CHEMEEN FRY
Served quirkily in an old-fashioned iron box, these tiger prawns cooked in the skin are juicy and moist despite being charred. The prawns certainly hold their own against spicy assault of the red chilli aided by the toasty notes of coconut oil.
rs. 300 (usd 4.2)
9/10

KITABILEY KOZHI PORICHATHU
A chicken dish that will certainly hold your attention with its hot and spicy kick, If you‚Äôre faint-hearted, you may want to tame the chilli in this satay with a squeeze of lime.
rs. 235 (usd 3.3)
8.5/10

KALLUMAKAYA NIRACHATHU
A popular Kozhikoden snack, this dish of mussels stuffed with rice flour and then deep-fried with spices is a fixture on almost every restaurant menu. rs. 25 (usd 0.4) per piece
7.5/1

KUNZHI KOZHI NIRACHATHU
This roasted spring chicken, stuffed with mutta (egg) and masala made of loads of onions, thick coconut milk and cashew paste, makes for a rich bite, one that‚Äôs worthy of being served as a traditional first breakfast to a groom after the wedding. rs. 235 (usd 3.3)
10/10

ELANEER CHICKEN
Thickened with tender coconut and garnished with slivers of fresh coconut, this chicken stew is an ode to the versatility of the fruit of the cocos nucifera. There‚Äôs a gentle sweetness to this velvety stew and the gentle warmth of ginger and green chilli. 
rs. 294 (usd 4.1)
9/10

MAPRANAM FISH CURRY
A vivacious curry that reflects typical toddy shop fare. The sour notes of the kokum dominate this ayakora or kingfish curry, followed by the heat of red chillies and the pungency of garlic. Savour this with boiled rice.
rs. 500 (usd 6.9) price varies, depending on the size of fish.
9/10 

CHATTI CHORU
Basically, the equivalent of a sadhya served in a claypot (chatti). Work the choru (rice) with the smorgasbord of dishes in the chatti, be it the dry shrimp chutney, the fried fish, aviyal or the fish thiyal, or coriander fish curry. rs. 80 (usd 1.1)
8/10

PAROTTA KIZHI
A weighty dish of three parottas drenched in coconut milk and wrapped around chicken masala and steamed in a banana leaf bundle. A sumptuous one-dish meal. 
rs. 190 (usd 2.6)
8/10

AVIL MILK (CALICUT FALOODA)
AC‚Äôs spin on the Malabar staple, avil milk, is loaded with calories but sinfully delicious!

10. Finish with fresh cream, kasuri methi powder,and fresh coriander leaves

Best Malabar Snacks. Bombay Hotel Kozhikode. Calicut Bombay Hotel, Kozhikode Street Food, Moplah Snacks At Bombay Hotel Calicut. Elanchi. Unakaya. Mutton Cutlet. Biryani Chai. Chemmeen Cake.

A landmark on Silk Street, Kozhikode, Bombay Hotel has stood the test of time for 70 years and is still going strong, dishing out over 20 varieties of Moplah snacks come tea time every day! 

The spot to savour some Malabari snack classics and this is exactly what Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna does in this episode of Gourmet On The Road. He treats himself to the elanchi (thin crepes stuffed with a mix of bananas, coconut, sugar and raisins), a custardy savoury chemmeen or prawn cake, a biryani chai and much more! 

BIRYANI CHAI
A fancy name for this gimmicky tea poured skilfully into a glass such that the milk and tea liquor hold their own in a dancing swirl! Fancy name aside, and there are no biryani spices in this, the tea makes for a punchy companion to the loaded desserts and savouries here. 
rs. 22 (usd 0.3) 
8/10

CHICKEN PUFF
Not so pleasing to the eye, the chicken puff is flavourful. A deep-fried maida puff stuffed with chicken, onions green chillies and turmeric, this snack makes for a delicious accompaniment to some hot chai!
rs. 22 (usd 0.3) 
8/10

MUTTON CUTLET
A filling cutlet of meat and onions flavoured with ginger. I was expecting a more meaty flavour, but you taste mostly the onions and some flour that‚Äôs gone in as a binder in this snack. 
rs. 20 (usd 0.3) 
7/10

ERACHI PATHIRI
This stuffed pathiri is generous on the onions, but a trifle sparing on the meat, which in itself has a bit of a bite. Prepare to spend some time chewing on this.
rs. 35 (usd 0.5) 
7/10

CHEMEEN CAKE
a cake with a difference, this savoury steamed cake comprises of spiced shrimp sandwiched between layers of the soft cake. On the palate, I detect a hint of sweetness which contrasts with the mildly spicy shrimp. You can definitely taste the shrimp flavour in this! 
rs. 28 (usd 0.4) 
8.5/10

ELANCHI
A moist wobbly pancake that‚Äôs stuffed with ripe banana, fresh coconut, sugar and nuts. The tart sweetness of the banana combined with the juicy bite of the coconut is endearing, clearly a dessert that‚Äôs a must-try here.
rs. 17 (usd 0.2) 
10/10

MUTTAPOLA
They love eggs in desserts at Bombay Hotel, and this egg white and ripe banana steamed cake is a taste to be acquired. 
rs. 19 (usd 0.3) 
7/10

SP UNNAKAYA
A sticky maida fritter with a coconut, banana and egg filling. I was bracing to taste some ‚Äòegginess‚Äô, but thankfully you don‚Äôt. One tastes the sweet tartness of the banana and the flavour of the coconut. Certainly a snack that grows on you.
rs. 17 (usd 0.2) 
8.5/10

ELADA
A gooey steamed rice cake stuffed with coconut, banana, some lentils and jaggery, best eaten with a spoon. The rice casing is slightly mushy in texture, but the hero of this treat is certainly the banana. 
rs. 20 (usd 0.3) 
7/10

LEMON TEA
the lemon tea helps reset your palate and appetite if you want to dive back into some of the delicacies at bombay hotel. 
rs. 10 (usd 0.1)

"MAKING of CHICKEN BIRYANI at KERALA‚Äôs Most Popular PARAGON RESTAURANT, Kozhikode | Tasting 11 DISHES",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCItca_ZBj4,"#MostPopularRestaurantInKerala #ParagonHotelKozhikode #GourmetOnTheRoad

Most Popular Restaurant In Kerala. Paragon Restaurant Kozhikode. Paragon Chicken Biryani recipe, Chicken Dum Biryani, Crab Bhumika, Meen Moilee, Mango Fish Curry, Mutton Varthiyathu.

A Keralan culinary institution that people are familiar with not just in the state but beyond its borders, Paragon Restaurant, is perhaps the oldest and by large the most popular restaurant in the city of Kozhikode. Established in way back in 1939, Paragon has built an empire across the world with restaurants in various parts of Kerala and the Middle East. 

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits the iconic restaurant on Kannur Road, where Paragon was born to meet Sumesh, third-generation owner. He then visits the kitchen to watch their revered Paragon Chicken Biriyani being made from scratch. He then sits down to savour some of the most ordered dishes on the menu.

PRAWN DRY FRY
You taste the sweetness of the fresh prawns and the fragrance of the coconut oil in which this crustacean is fried. The prawn is perfectly seasoned and cooked textbook perfect to a yielding crunch and succulent inside.
rs. 315 (usd4.4) 
10/10

PAN FRIED MUSSELS
The mussels are cooked supple in a savoury mix of onions, curry leaves and green chillies. A play of flavours and textures, one tastes the toasty lilt of the curry leaves, the bite of the onions and gentle heat of the pepper.
rs. 331 (usd4.7) 
9/10

PAN FRIED SQUID
The squid, though cooked to a pleasing springy bite is quite neutral in its flavour and needs to be cocooned in the masala for it to make an impression on the palate.
rs. 273 (usd3.8) 
7.5/10

TAMARIND FISH
This Paragon creation teases the senses with its medley of flavours. You taste the sourness that comes from the vinegar, the sweetness of jaggery and the lingering warmth of ginger in the sauce in which the fried kingfish is tossed. 
rs. 336 (usd4.7) 
9/10

CRAB BHUMIKA
I love the size of these juicy sea crabs, they're soft and one can bite into them whole to relish the flavours of the dish. You taste the sweetness of the crab meat, the freshness of the ingredients, coriander, green chillies, ginger, garlic and the sour twang of lime.  
rs. 231 (usd3.2) 
9/10

AVOLI MOILEE
The delicate white pomfret is the perfect accomplice to the mellow, soothing flavours of this creamy coconut stew, punctuated with the notes of kokum, curry leaves and green chilli. Enjoy this with a lacey appam.
rs. 452 (usd6.3) 
9/10

MANGO FISH CURRY
Another popular dish here, the ayakora or kingfish has imbibed the sour notes of the raw mango. The shallots add a robust bite and the heat from slivers of ginger contrasts with the slightly sour notes of this curry.
rs. 273 (usd3.8) 
10/10

MUTTON VARTIYATHU
A mutton preparation that‚Äôs rich in flavour and texture. The meat, onions, tomatoes and spices have been slow-cooked for a few hours to come together in a lush gravy. 
rs. 254 (usd3.6) 
9.5/10

CHICKEN BIRIYANI
The biriyani here is plated in a layered mound, milky white grains of the mildly aromatic kaima rice or jeerakasala rice sit at the crest, followed by a layer of masala-stained rice, a savoury ribbon of masala and fried onions separating the two. 
rs. 168 (usd 2.4)

"Most Popular FISH FRY in Kozhikode| Amma Hotel | Kingfish, Red Snapper,Fish Meals| Calicut Food Tour",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY1WjqpOSCI,"#AmmaHotel #Kozhikode #GourmetOnTheRoad

Most Popular Fish Fry and Fish Meal Restaurant in Kozhikode, Amma Hotel, Ayakora (Kingfish) Fry, Chembali (Red Snapper) Fry, Fish Meal

Come lunchtime and locals in Kozhikode (Calicut) flock to this eatery set in a home in the tiny bylanes of Puthiyara. What draws the crowd here is their Ayakora or Kingfish fry and their satisfying fish meal served on a banana leaf.

Food Lovers‚Äô editor, Kripal Amanna visits this fish fry icon and after a tour of the kitchen where fish are slathered with a secret masala, lashings of coconut oil and fried over a rubber wood fire, sits down for a sumptuous meal.   

AYAKORA (KINGFISH) FRY
a much loved fish in the city, found in almost every eatery. Served here with a thick layer of a spirited masala slathered on a thick slice of kingfish, the bite of the masala has almost tamed the flavour of the fish. Slightly salty and redolent with the aroma of coconut oil, the fish fry masala is also a great accompaniment to be savoured with the rice and lentil curry. 
rs 160. (usd 2.2)
9.5/10

CHEMBALI (RED SNAPPER) FRY
a plump piece of red snapper naped with the Amma Hotel masala. Since this is a meatier fish than the ayakora, the masala doesn‚Äôt penetrate all the way in. if you like your fish fry robustly flavoured the ayakora is for you. but if you like it spicy and still want to enjoy the flavour of the fish the red snapper is what you should be trying. 
rs 150. (usd 2.1)
9/10


FISH MEALS
The swollen grains of kuruva rice are the perfect medium to carry the flavours of a tasty vegetable paruppu curry and also tame the aggression of the spices in the fish fry masala. For a mere 50 rupees, this unlimited meal that includes a simple choora (tuna) curry, valakaya (raw banana) upperi and rasam, is a meal that provides nourishment, satisfaction and taste!

"Authentic, BEST Mappila Meal | ZAIN‚ÄôS HOTEL| Kozhikode |Cooking CHICKEN BIRYANI‚Ä¶ Mutton Stew|Calicut",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_sT12PwaKg,"#MappilaCuisine #Kozhikode #GourmetOnTheRoad

Authentic Moplah Cuisine in Kozhikode at Zain‚Äôs Hotel, Calicut, Mappila Cuisine, Chatti Pathiri, Kallumakaya, Mutton Stew, Chicken Biryani, Ghee Rice, Chicken Masala

Zain‚Äôs Hotel Kozhikode stands testament to Mrs Zainabi Noor‚Äôs firm resolve to showcase the Mappila cuisine of her family. Kozhikode‚Äôs first lady restaurateur, she began her culinary enterprise 29 years ago as a small tea stall dispensing evening snacks. Spurred by the love she received from her customers, Zain‚Äôs today stands tall in Calicut as the address for homestyle Malabar cuisine.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits this cosy restaurant set in a home and meets the mother-daughter duo of Zainabi Noor and Shireen Mustafa who oversee every detail of the operation. He also looks at the making of their popular chicken biryani, ghee rice and chicken masala in their kitchen ‚Äòmanned‚Äô only by lady cooks, before sitting down to a generous lunch.

CHATTI PATHIRI 
A 12-layered baked pancake interspersed with eggs, poppy seeds and raisins, each bite is a delicious crunch followed by luscious overtones of the ghee, caramelised sugar and the textural play of nuts. This is one dessert that‚Äôs a must-have here.
rs 25. (usd 0.4)
8.5/10

KALLUMAKAYA NIRACHATHU
Twice cooked, first the mussels are steamed in a rice cake with spices and then fried, the kallumakaya niracathu is a speciality at Zain‚Äôs. Peel the shell away to reveal the mussel, the rice cake is a tad crunchy to the bite and yet moist within, the flavour of the masala has seeped into the rice dumpling. 
rs 29. (usd 0.4) per piece
10/10

FISH FRY
Lightly coated with a masala that plays second fiddle to the flavours of the plump ayakora or kingfish, this fry snares the moist flakey-ness of the fish in a light crunch. The turmeric lends it a delightful golden-orange hue. 
rs 200. (usd 2.8) per piece
8.5/10

MUTTON STEW
Rich in coconut milk, this creamy stew carries within itself juicy chunks of meat that is yielding and flavourful. The tingling sensation of green chillies on the palate is balanced by the ripe acidity of the tomatoes. Best savoured with the ghee rice.
rs 250. (usd 3.5) per piece
10/10

GHEE RICE AND CHICKEN MASALA
The rich chicken masala makes for the perfect companion to the aromatic ghee rice. Rounding up the rich tones of the onions, tomatoes and curry leaves is the coconut oil that floats to the top of this dish, absorbing the flavours of the vivacious masala along the way. 
Chicken masala rs 150. (usd 2.1), ghee rice rs 60 (usd 0.8) 
8.5/10

CHICKEN BIRYANI
This isn't a biryani that jostles your tastebuds, it embraces your palate gently with light flavours of the fried onions and spices. The chicken is moist, having absorbed the flavours of the marinade as it cooks slowly over dum for an hour. The biryani exudes a hint of smokiness, and is almost buttery on the palate thanks to the ghee, oil and vanaspati that goes into the cooking of this biryani.
rs 150. (usd 2.1)

"Making & Tasting Of The Famous AMBUR BIRYANI in Ambur | RAHAMANIYA BRIYANI HOTEL | Mutton, Chicken",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBfd9Z3wlOc,"#Biryani #Ambur #TamilNadu #Mutton #GourmetOnTheRoad

Rahamaniya Briyani Hotel, Home of the legendary Ambur Briyani, Making of Ambur Mutton Biryani, serving the biryani since 1890 in Ambur, Tamil Nadu

With a culinary legacy that spans 130 years and four generations, Rahamaniya Briyani Hotel is considered to be the home of the Ambur Briyani. Spelt Briyani by the denizens of this bustling town, this dish has spawned many a biryani shop across the region.

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna meets three generations of the Ahmed family and gets exclusive insider access to the kitchens of Rahamania Briyani Hotel to watch the making of an Ambur mutton briyani from scratch.

He also tastes the briyani and a moist Naatu Kozhi briyani in addtion to a couple of meaty sides.


GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATINGS

MUTTON BRIYANI
this biryani is seductively subtle in its aroma. you taste the luscious flavours of the aqhni in every grain of the flavourful jeera samba rice. The juicy meat pieces are small, allowing you to savour its meaty goodness in almost every mouthful of the briyani. If you like your briyani a little spirited and slightly spicy, taste it with the eggplant salan. I personally love this 'briyani' just by itself.
rs 200.
10/10

NAATU KOZHI BRIYANI
prepared in the same fashion as the mutton version, the flavour of the rice is very similar to the mutton briyani sans the flavour of the fat in the latter. The flavourful country chicken has a bit of a bite, typical of its character. If you love your naatu kozhi, you will love this briyani too. 
rs 210.
9/10

CHICKEN LEG PIECE
Marinated deep-fried leg of chicken, fried to the perfect crisp outside yet retains its juicy moistness within. relish it with the toasty, herbaceous flavours of the curry leaves that are fried alongside the chicken.
rs 40. 
8/10

VANJARAM FRY
Encased in a robust masala that‚Äôs rich in its fenugreek flavour notes, the seer fish fry is a tasty distraction from the legendary briyani here. The savouriness of the curry leaves and the acidity of the lime definitely perks up the flavours of the fish. 
The skin has been fried to a crisp 
rs 160.

Delicious NORTH KARNATAKA Jolada Rotti Meals & Snacks At HOTEL NALAPAKA In Bangalore,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z19xf8VvbKQ,"#NorthKaranatakaMeals #RestaurantsInBengaluru #GourmetOnTheRoad

North Karnataka Food, Bangalore. Vegetarian Meals. Hotel Nalapaka Rajajinagar. Jolada Rotti Meals. Davanagere Benne Dosa. Girmit. Mirchi Bajji. Biranji.

An eatery located in the western suburbs of Bengaluru, Hotel Nalapaka‚Äôs rustic Karnataka meals are an experience one must definitely devour! Ms Kavitha Lingayya who hails from North Karnataka, set up the restaurant 20 years ago with the motive of sharing her beloved cuisine with the city. She first begun serving food out of a car shed, moving to catering to office-goers and then finally moving to a bigger space, Hotel Nalapaka.

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers Editor, Kripal Amanna visits the eatery after it came much-recommended by viewers, to savours a North Karnataka-style meal for lunch. He meets with Ms Kavitha, visits her kitchen and also takes a look at how their famous jolada rottis are made the traditional way. He then sits down to a meal, and makes a beginning with tasting the popular snacks on offer, namely the Girmit, Mirchi Bajji and Davanagere Benne Dose. He then tastes the Thursday special Biranji meals, served with toasty jowar rotis topped with a big dollop of butter, he wolfs these down with a creamy brinjal curry, lentil preparations and chutneys!

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATINGS

GIRMIT
often considered north karnataka‚Äôs take on a bhel puri, this snack is nothing like one! the addition of an onion tempering and gram flour to a mixture of turmeric stained puffed rice, raw onions and coriander is what makes the girmit different. make sure to chase a bite down with the fried chilli which perks up the flavours of this dish.
rs 36. (0.50 usd)
8/10

DAVANAGERE BUTTER DOSA
the perfect lacey and crisp texture of this dosa makes you want to dive straight into eating it! served with a lightly tempered potato palya and coconut chutney. the crunch in every bite followed by the lush butter that coats the palate is what makes this a superb dosa! rs 57. (0.80 usd)
8.5/10

MIRCHI BAJJI
love the way they make the chilli bajji here. the lightly spiced batter encases the chilli but not all the way through. you can see the spicy green chilli. you taste the spice of the chilli despite the thick casing. rs 21. (0.30 usd)
8/10

JOLADA ROTTI MEAL WITH BIRANJI 
this jolada rotti meal is wholesome in every sense! the rottis are light, fluffy and have a nutty flavour. when eaten with that lush butter and chutneys (the shenga or peanut chutney was my favourite) they are all the more delicious! the badnekayi is tangy and cream,  while the thick dal is fortified with fresh methi and the madike kalu is cooked to that perfect crunch. rs 192. (2.70 usd)
9/10

BIRANJI RICE
this aromatic rice quite similar in appearance to a pulav is a popular rice dish in the town of ranebennur, north karnataka. it is served only on thursdays as part of the jolada rotti meals at Nalapakka. the spices, cloves, cardamom, are reminiscent of a pulav but the addition of the lightly toasted garlic takes it in a new direction. every grain of rice is also speckled with that special biranji masala. the toasted cashew and butter makes this a rich preparation.

Tasting Famous Podi Idli At MURUGAN IDLI SHOP | Krishnagiri | GHEE MASALA DOSA | PONGAL |JIGARTHANDA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grqgqXCPNl4,"#TamilBreakfast #HighwayRestaurants #GourmetOnTheRoad

An iconic breakfast spot in Tamil Nadu, Murugan Idli Shop that first began in Madurai, today, has scores of branches in Chennai. The restaurant‚Äôs latest outlet in Krishnagiri, has turned into the place to stop at for patrons driving from Bengaluru either towards Salem, Madurai or Chennai.

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna makes a quick stop at the eatery for a late breakfast, tasting some of the must-tries on the menu. This includes the restaurant‚Äôs signature Podi Idli, a paper-thin Masala Dosa, a ghee-laden Pongal, the Jigarthanda and more!

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATINGS
PLAIN IDLI
not the softest idli you will come across, this one borders on being slightly firm. you taste the tart fermented edge of the batter. the idli is best enjoyed with the chutneys. the coriander chutney has a fresh flavour while the mint chutney makes for a zesty bite. my favourite accompaniment is the nourishing sambar fortified with lentils. the texture of the idli makes it perfect to be dunked in the sambar. 
rs 20. (0.30 usd)
7.5/10

GHEE PODI IDLI
this idli is a lot more softer and has a certain springiness to it. Slathered with ghee and doused in a spirited, spicy podi, its texture is a lot more pleasing to the palate. the heat of the podi is tamed when eaten with the creamy lentils in the sambar. this is a delicious idli!
rs 32. (0.45 usd)
9/10

SPECIAL SWEET PONGAL 
this dish is laden with ghee, so much so that it feels like you aren‚Äôt just eating the pongal but the ghee too! the dish isn‚Äôt cloying sweet, the amount of jaggery used is just right. the addition of toasted cashews gives it a nice bite and also helps cut through that dairy richness of the ghee. 
rs 58. (0.80 usd)
8/10

GHEE MASALA DOSA
the dosa is crisp and translucent. you can hear it go crunch as you break into it. the potato filling is creamy, almost pate-like. a bit excessive on the salt but flavourful nonetheless. the dosa batter in no way interferes with the flavours of this soft mash. the dosa surprisingly manages to retain its crunch despite being dunked into the sambar. it's almost like biting into a puff pastry, that's how delicately crunchy this dosa is!
rs 108. (1.50 usd)
9/10

ONION UTHAPPAM
love the way this uthappam is loaded with onions! the onion has been roasted to a deep brown. you taste the delicious caramelised notes of the almost burnt onion on the top layer followed by the sweet crunch of the lightly sauteed onions below it. the thick uthappam just cradles all these delicious textures and flavours! the chutney provides for a nice break, if it gets too onion-y.
rs 89. (1.25 usd)
8.5/10

JIGARTHANDA
literally translating to ‚Äòcool the heart‚Äô the jigarthanda is a very popular cooler on the menu here. the orange flavoured ice cream made in-house has a texture that‚Äôs somewhere in between a gelato and sorbet. the jelly has almond essence in it, you can also taste the dairy from the basundi. if you like something cooling and refreshing, settle for this drink.
rs 70. (1 usd)
7/10

FILTER COFFEE
my choice of drink after a south indian breakfast! the sweet bitterness of the filter coffee is the right way to end a slightly over indulgent breakfast here at murugan idli shop. 
rs 32. (0.45 usd)
8/10

Tasting BHEEMA'S Most Popular ANDHRA VEG MEALS | MUTTON BIRYANI | Chilli Chicken | KITCHEN TOUR!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-igroeATQ0,"#AndhraCuisine #RestaurantsInBangalore #GourmetOnTheRoad

Best Restaurant For An Andhra Meal In Bangalore. Andhra Restaurants In Bangalore. Andhra Style Biryani. Andhra Meals.

A popular name when it comes to Andhra cuisine in Bengaluru is Bheema's, an iconic restaurant located in the heart of CBD, at Church Street. Although the street has witnessed a resurgence over the years, this over 20-year-old establishment has stood still, turning into a favourite spot for lunch, when in the area.

The simple yet satisfying vegetarian Andhra meal served on a plantain leaf and the Nellore-style Biryani is what patrons usually flock to the restaurant for, not forgetting their signature side, the Bheema's Chicken!

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers' Editor, Kripal Amanna visits the restaurant after a decade to revive memories of a meal here. He meets with second generation owner, Vijaykumar and explores the kitchen. He discover the evolution in the method of cooking traditional Andhra fare Bheema's has adopted and also visits the restaurants' nursery!

He then sits down to indulge in the vegetarian meals with oodles of ghee and gongura chutney, moving on to taste the Mutton Biryani and some delicious meaty sides. 

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATING
VEG MEALS¬†
¬†a popular lunch choice at bheema‚Äôs, the veg meal comprises of a pappu, a vegetable of the day, sambar, rasam, perugu, buttermilk and dessert, usually a payasam. my top picks were the deliciously creamy spinach pappu, the flavourful sambar. the moolangi chutney was not as vibrant or vivacious as the gongura chutney. don‚Äôt forget to top your piping hot rice with ghee and the signature podi before you work your way through the dishes!
rs 205. (2.90 usd)¬†
8.5/10


CHILLI CHICKEN
although this chilli chicken has an incredible amount of chilli seeds, it doesn‚Äôt hit you right away when you first taste it. but as you devour the dish, the green chilli spice makes its presence felt on the palate. the chicken is moist and juicy. eat this dish with rice and oodles of ghee to help tame the chilli aggression.¬†
rs 260. (3.65 usd)
8.5/10


BHEEMA'S CHICKEN
this fried chicken preparation is a bheema‚Äôs signature. the chicken is coated and fried in a light batter and tossed in a masala which makes liberal use of green chilli and curry leaves. this fried chicken is cooked perfectly, crunchy and dry outside yet soft and juicy within. the curry leaves lends a toasty, herbaceous note to the dish.¬†¬†
rs 270. (3.80 usd)
9/10


MUTTON BIRYANI
this biryani is gentle in its aromas, not a biryani you can smell from a mile away. the rice is cooked in the flavourful mutton broth that has given up all its meaty flavour to the supremely flavoursome rice. you can also taste the whole spices like cloves, cinnamon and star anise. the meat is cooked to a juicy, tender pink.
rs 285. (4 usd)
8.5/10


MUTTON PEPPER FRY
the meat is the star in this mutton pepper fry. it is slow cooked and braised for hours resulting in that tender, melt-in-the-mouth texture. the flesh is pink all the way through and the fat too has rendered well. the pepper does not obliterate the flavour of the mutton.¬† the curry leaves provide a nice respite in between tasting. the flavour of the meat and spices have come together beautifully in this dish!¬†

"MARATHA STYLE NON VEGETARIAN Food | MARATA DARSHAN | Naati Koli Saaru, Mutton Chops & More!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF5Yb2q-0VA,"#MilitaryHotelsInBangalore #NonVegetarianFood #GourmetOnTheRoad

Maratha Cuisine In Bengaluru. Military Style Food In Bangalore. Ragi Mudde and Mutton Chops Thali.

Gorge on mouthwatering military-style food, especially robust mutton dishes at Marata Darshan in Bengaluru. Established by Shantharaj Lad back in 1989, this humble eatery is known for its wholesome military style meals served for breakfast and lunch. Presently run by the father, mother and son trio, the reason behind the restaurant‚Äôs success are traditional recipes by the mother, Hemavathi Bai.

Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna meets the family in this episode of Gourmet On The Road. He unveils the secret behind the eatery‚Äôs success and explores the must eat dishes here through a short kitchen tour. He then sit downs for a meal tasting the Mutton Chops Thali served with either rice and the restaurant‚Äôs signature Ragi Mudde, Koli Saaru, Mutton Kheema Curry and a bowl of Soppina Saaru. He also tastes must-try sides, a peppery Mutton Liver Fry, a flavourful Chilli Chicken, a wet Chicken 65 made with a yoghurt gravy and Mutton Korma.

NAATI KOLI SAARU
the gravy of this naati koli saaru certainly has some chilli kick to it. one can also taste layers of spice and the garam masala. the soft, pasty ragi mudde is perfect to be dunked into this flavourful saaru.
rs 200. (2.80 usd)
9/10

MUTTON CHOPS
the meat in this hearty curry has a good distribution of fat and the mutton still has its bite intact. the masala has a mellow lingering heat perhaps from some warm spices like cloves and cinnamon. the mutton with the gravy makes for a juicy bite.
rs 170 (2.40 usd)
9/10

CHICKEN PEPPER
this chicken is liberally spiced with pepper that gives it a delicious, toasty flavour note. you taste the juiciness of the chicken that has been cooked to perfection and the freshness of coarse ground pepper and a slight savouriness perhaps from some onion.
rs 140 (2 usd)
9/10

CHILLI CHICKEN
easily one of the best ‚Äòlocal-style‚Äô chilli chicken I have tasted! the chicken just yields, and parts effortlessly from the bone. the masala made with plenty of tomatoes and green chilli is fingerlicking good! the chilli heat isn‚Äôt palate-numbing like other versions of its ilk.
rs 130. (1.80 usd)
9.5/10

CHICKEN 65
the chicken 65 here is a wet gravy of chicken kebab tossed in a thick gravy of yoghurt, curry leaves, dry red chillies and spices. the flavour of the dish is a little too tart, an interesting take on the 65, but plays a distant second fiddle to the other dishes.
rs 140 (2 usd)
7/10

KHEEMA UNDE GRAVY
love the rogan or thin veil of fat floating over this thick, lush gravy that is perfect to be ladelled over the unde or meatball. all you taste is the meat and the gentle spicing. the gravy merely straddles the unde without overpowering its nuanced flavour. the quality of meat in this dish is just brilliant!
rs 170 (2.40 usd)
9.5/10

MUTTON LIVER PEPPER FRY
mutton liver can usually be tough when cooked this way but in this dish, the meaty liver is quite yielding to the bite. there's none of the gamey meatiness. you taste the roasted pepper.  to hold itself up to the meatiness of the liver, the strength of the pepper is a lot more apparent in this preparation.
rs 170 (2.40 usd)
8.5/10

SOPPINA SAARU
love the earthy flavours of this soppina saaru that is made with a bunch of different greens. you can sense the nourishment you get from every scoop of rice that's soaked in the soppina saaru!
8.5/10

RASAM 
this almost clear rasam has an apparent tartness from some tamarind and you can definitely taste prominent notes of cumin or jeera. 
7/10

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna visits the Ulsoor outlet and meets with the brother duo that run the restaurant. He discusses the procurement of fresh seafood, the variety of curries on offer and also witnesses the making of two most popular fries, the Bangude and the Kane Fry.

He then sits down to a feast, tasting a bevy of coastal dishes, from a Pomfret Curry, Crab Masala, Khoobey Mootlien, Chicken Roce Curry and more!

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATINGS

RAGI MANNI 
the manni has a lush, creamy texture that takes over your palate! you taste the caramel notes of the jaggery. this mangalorean dessert resembles the Italian panacotta minus the cream. definitely a delicious way to end your meal here.
rs 60 (0.90 usd)
8/10

KHUBEY MOOTLIEN
this dish deserves attention when being savoured, especially when picking on the tiny yet sweet and mildly briny clam flesh. the rice dumpling has a sticky, slightly slimy texture that goes very well with the thick, velvety coconut based gravy. the flavour of the clams in this dish is reminiscent of the ocean.
rs 170 (2.40 usd)
8.5/10

CRAB MASALA
tossed in a semi-dry onion and tomato masala that complements the mildly sweet, flesh of this dotted sea crab don‚Äôt forget to suck on the crab meat!

rs 480 (6.70 usd)
9/10

KANE TAWA FRY
this fish is as fresh as it gets! so delicates that the meat just flakes apart effortlessly. the pullimunchi masala gives off a warming note o f the byadgi chilli and also a slight tartness from vinegar. the fish has absorbed the masala, yet retains its unique flavour. be mindful of the tiny pin bones though!
rs 280. (4 usd)
9/10

BANGUDE FRY
the butterflied mackerel allows for the masala to penetrate the deep flavours of this fish. notwithstanding this, the mackerel asserts its strong flavour from the word go despite being fried in a spicy masala.
rs 120 (1.70 usd)
9/10

CHICKEN ROCE CURRY
a popular choice of chicken curry at mangalore pearl made with coconut milk, fried onions and gentle spices. best savoured with the soft, spongy sannas that disintegrate as it absorbs this flavourful curry. the chicken though, tastes better when in the company of the creamy curry.
rs 220. (3 usd)
8.5/10

PRAWN GHEE ROAST
soaking in oodles of ghee this is one of the best prawn ghee roasts i‚Äôve tasted! the prawns are plump and fresh, being coated in all that roasted masala that does not overpower its sweet flavour. the neer dosa serves as the perfect combination to this dish. the beautiful balance of spice, toasty flavour notes of coconut oil, rich ghee and divine prawns will keep you coming back for this dish!
rs 295 (4.10 usd)

Hotel Nayaab Old City Hyderabad, Restaurants Of Old City Hyderabad, Muslim-Style Hyderabadi Cuisine

In this episode of Gourmet On The road we set out in search for some delicious Hyderabadi fare. This culinary conquest led us to the Old City, an area that boasts of some of the most iconic, traditional Hyderabadi eateries. 

Hotel Nayaab, an establishment over three decades old, located right at the entrance of bustling Chatta Bazaar, Nayapul Road, Charminar, is a favourite amongst locals and tourists. Food Lovers‚Äô Editor, Kripal Amanna catches up with Omer Aziz of Hotel Nayaab to understand the typical Hyderabadi fare served here. He explains how the Nihari, a broth that makes for the Paya Soup is slowly simmered over hours and also steps into the kitchen to discover the making of two extremely popular dishes.

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATING

NIHARI  
this is a comforting dish perfect to be enjoyed on a nippy evening! you taste the nourishing goodness of the juices from meat bones and the warm spices. the thin veil of fat on top rounds off all flavours. the deep savouriness of fried onion and the fresh hit of coriander adds another layer to the nihari.
rs 100.
9/10

MALAI PAYA/ PAYA MASALA 
definitely an indulgent take on the austere paya! the gravy is enriched with thick cream. the trotter itself is melt-in-the-mouth. Perhaps not for the purist.
rs 240.
8/10

BHEJA MASALA 
this bheja preparation is as light as air! it melts away leaving behind the delicious, custardy flavour of the brain. the masala is unctuous, smoky yet delicate in flavour.
rs 160.
9/10

BHEJA PEPPER FRY
the gentle heat of the pepper creeps up the back of your throat. the bheja is cooked beautifully and the masala, heavy on pepper and coriander balances against the intense creamy bite of the brain.. 
rs 160.
9/10

MUTTON TALAHUA
the masala is reminiscent of an achari masala with its tart edge. it‚Äôs perfect to mop up with a piece of roti. the boneless mutton chunks are well cooked and have absorbed that masala.
rs 220.
8/10

DAL FRY 
this nourishing lentil curry is thick and rich. it is more of a south indian style dal that is slightly tart, tempered with curry leaves and mustard. 
rs 150.
8/10

MUTTON BIRYANI
every grain of rice is separate and has absorbed the flavour of the meat. the meat itself has its flavour and a bit of its bite intact. one can also taste the robustness of the spices that have gone into this biryani. the salan has a mild pickling flavour note that helps break the rich spice notes of the biryani. 
rs 200.
8/10

QUBANI KA MEETHA 
this dessert is a tad syrupy. the malai with its richness helps balance out the overwhelming sweetness. the nuttiness from the apricot kernels pack twice the flavour of almonds and breaks the monotony of flavours.

Nagarjuna Vs Meghana Foods|Tasting Bengaluru‚Äôs Most Popular Andhra Biryanis|Mutton & Chicken Biryani,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-fw6B2ZRg0,"#BestAndhraBiryani #Bangalore #GourmetOnTheRoad

Most Popular Biryani Restaurants In Namma Bengaluru. Best Restaurants For Spicy Andhra Biryani In Bangalore.

Widely famous for their Andhra & Hyderabadi style of biryanis, Nagarjuna and Meghana Foods are often pitted against each other. Without surprise both these eateries have a devoted following, most who swear-by the biryanis.

Nagarjuna, an establishment that was set up in the early 1980s serves two Andhra-style, dum biryanis, a Mutton and a Chicken while Meghana Foods, a relatively new eatery serves an array of biryani to choose from, the most popular of which is a spicy, Chicken Boneless Biryani.

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers Editor, Kripal Amanna, tastes both biryanis at Nagarjuna and three of the crowd favourites at Meghana Foods, reviewing what makes each of these biryanis special.

In conclusion, he tells viewers what could be the biryani for them based on their preferences!

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATINGS

CHICKEN BIRYANI
studded with a fair bit of whole spices - cloves, cardamom and cinnamon, which gives the biryani rice a fulsome flavour that serves well to embrace the chicken.
rs 265
8/10

MUTTON BIRYANI
the rice is similar in flavour to the chicken biryani, but the spices here seem more accentuated. The meat is soft, you can taste the gamey flavours of the fat.¬†
rs 305
8.5/10

CHICKEN BONELESS BIRYANI
made with long grain basmati rice, each grain is separate. topped with boneless chicken morsels coated in a thick, spirited masala, this is a biryani you can definitely share.
rs 248
8/10

CHICKEN DUM BIRYANI
served with a leg of chicken that is coated in a savoury, caramelised onion masala that threads through the long grained rice. the meat is cooked to the bone and is flavourful. a biryani that leaves you more than satisfied!
rs 242¬†
8.5/10

MUTTON BIRYANI
the spicing in meghana biryanis is apparent on the palate, but absent on the plate. one sees no hint of any of the spices that have gone into the dish, but you can taste its presence. the masala in the mutton biryani is mellower than in the chicken version, allowing the flavour of the meat to take precedence.¬†

Savouring the Taste Of Coorg In Mysore! SIMPLY KODAVAS | Pandi Curry | Chicken Curry | Pork Biryani,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYmbFUntjz8,"#Kodava #MysoreFoodTrail #GourmetOnTheRoad
Authentic Kodava Food In Mysore Only At Simply Kodavas!

Finding authentic Kodava food outside Coorg can be quite the task but for the citizens of Mysuru however, Simply Kodavas is the place to go! This family-run restaurant features traditional Kodava art and serves up classic Kodava dishes.

In this episode of Gourmet On The Road, Food Lovers‚Äô Editor Kripal Amanna pays a visit to this restaurant and chats with the owner and his son about this distinct cuisine. He samples the quintessential Kodava Pandi Curry a flavourful Pork Chilli, both finished with kachampuli. He also tastes a robust chicken curry and couple of unconventional dishes namely, the Pork Biryani and Pork Kebab. He savours all of this with some traditional Kodava rice-based staples like Kadamputtu, Noolputtu and Paaputtu. 

GOURMET ON THE ROAD RATING 
Pandi curry
you can taste roasted spices, fresh coriander, the tartness of the kachampuli and a peppery heat. A finger-lickingly good pork dish!
9/10
Rs. 160.

Pork chilli
the fat in this is spicy and flavourful! pork melts in your mouth and the delicious fat coats your palate. You have the deep brown roasted spices, a slight tartness from the kachampuli or coorgi vinegar, and the spice of the green chilli that lingers on the palate. a satisfying preparation!
9/10
Rs. 190.

Chicken curry
This curry definitely holds its own against the pork items in terms of flavour. Made with a spicy coconut base, the gravy has certainly been cooked for a while for the flavours to deepen!
9/10
Rs. 160.

Pork biryani
made more in the pulao style of cooking. The tiny morsels of tender pork have a certain smokiness that takes over your palate. Can also detect a hint of pickling spices. This is very different from a typical biryani. 
7/10
Rs. 180.

Pork kebab
The meat definitely has a bit of bite to it and the fat hasn't rendered down. Innovative dish but I‚Äôm not a fan. 
6/10
Rs. 200.

7/10

JAGGERY PONGAL
The jaggery is very evident in this short-grained rice dish, as is the edible camphor that immediately engulfs the palate. A touch of lentils add some creamy graininess to the bite.

HOTEL JANATHA 
KHAALI DOSA - HOTEL JANATHA
called ‚Äòkhaali‚Äô or ‚Äòempty‚Äô this dosa is served simply, with chutney on the side. the dosas are light and fluffy but definitely need the chutney to perk up its flavours. 
Rs 30.
6/10

He discovers that the prep here begins as early as 7am, and every dish is prepared using secret recipes and local ingredients!
