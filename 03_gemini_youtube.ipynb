       "  'transcription': \"[Music] mutton Biryani yes sir oh chicken biryani I love the aroma of that Biryani is jostling with the Smoky atmosphere of the [Music] [Music] place oh Chicken [Music] Chops PE High Bean fantastic and I'm told the combination here is the idly that idly is soft with some of that b also get some of that m well we are on the Bangalore Mangalore highway it's about 1:00 in the afternoon and we've stopped for lunch bangaluru is 200 km behind me cesur is roughly about 25 km so it's that time of the afternoon when I was feeling a little hungry and i' had heard of this place called namama harim man here in bayura in Hassen District so that's where we've arrived for lunch I don't know what the food here is all about but I've received requests from the establishments and also a few recommendations over a period of time so I think lunch here should certainly be interesting hello how is the food very good yeah what are you having mutton Biryani mutton Biryani Namaste sir namas new Mr yes sir fan of you thank you very much nice to meet you thank you sir thank you owning chicken birani fish fry chicken m yeah very soft [Music] idly bit of a smoky atmosphere here but that's always nice because they do the cooking over a wood fired store mutton Biryani yes buet rice rice I love the aroma of that Biryani is jostling with the Smokey atmosphere of the place oh chicken [Music] birani yes sir CH yeah yeah CH powder powder definitely smell the coriander in that M Masala Mt [Music] m [Music] oh Chicken Chops mil [Music] only so basically what he says is that the younger the animal is better for a Biryani because you want that meat to really dissolve and if the animal is older then that does well in the sambar yeah I like that bright vious red color of the basically it's a peeled Bean fantastic [Music] so muton Chicken on the dish Chicken Chops chicken biryani cab and [Music] open well this is one of those places that's fairly modest in fact if I didn't put GPS on I would have quite easily overshot this particular location thank God for Google Maps but I think it's the food in this place that rules because although I've received requests from omes GAA on Instagram earlier I've received many recommendations thereafter and also many of the customers that I met here are people whove been here before so they've tried the Biryani they've tried the kebab and that's why they've return to taste what cooks for them thank you you well they also have mud here so in case you want to eat your mud with the saru you can also do that but I saw those soft Mal ID steaming away in that casserole and I think that's what I'm going to have with the [Music] saru thank youo B goo yeah chicken kebab baju chicken kebab and some soft idly [Music] yeah so out here I think uh um GAA insists on you eating in a manner that he would like you to eat muton Kaa mut M [Music] mut Chicken Chops one by one the dishes are coming our table is full so I've got the Chicken Chops here there's a chicken kebab here those are the only two chicken dishes that we have there's also a Biryani that they do this of course is the B gojou and this is the bti that is made with the a b that is the Heen Bean this is a dish that I really had my eyes on the moment you opened the lid and I saw these Plum juicy kaima there's also a bit of charby that you see here a bit of fat right on top this is the mutton Curry and then we have a soft malig idly with some saru and some bti I want to taste that bti first just by itself some Curry [Music] Leaf I think the curries here are certainly the s that grip hold of your throat with a spicy furor there's certain thickness to that b gojou and I'm told the combination here is the idly that idly is soft with some of that b also get some of that a b m told me so before you try anything else please try the B it's a very popular dish and having tasted only a few morels of it I completely believe him the B is soft clean rather well as well and just has a lightest of bites this time it's some of that sambar this is a curry I think there's also a bit of meat in that [Music] the preparations here are the Sal that grip fold of your [Music] throat so even when I saw it in the kitchen most of the dishes out here are the s that are prepared with the red chilies so thises a combination of the byi for the color the G and manatu which is a local Nati chili which has a lot of heat and that's really what you're tasting on the throat M that idly is nice and [Music] soft for those of you like your ragim mud you also have the option of that but it's been a while since I've had a good idly mutton saru so I thought this was the combination to try and with the [Music] B let's try some of that chicken kebab there's a bit of green Chutney that they serve the Kebab with so I'm told he doesn't use any color in his kebab and that seems to be the case because it's not a kebab that's bright crimson red in its color it's a kebab that crunches well has a bit of a juiciness to it as well but not so impactful on the pette as that boty and that mutton saru when we walked in here there was nobody but right now every table is taken every chair taken and there are people waiting for a seat at the table that's how popular is I think next for some of that Chicken Chops get some of the saru there that thick gravy I can definitely taste the flavor of the Masala in that a bit of the coriander a bit of the cumin that's what I'm tasting in that saru is a bit rough around the edges not as smooth as that mutton saru chicken do is a bit tough they only do a couple of chicken dishes and I suspect it's the mutton dishes that find most favor with the customers here the chicken is for the occasional perhaps visitor for those who don't eat mutton and they happen to be stuck with a group of uh mutton lovers well then they have the Chicken Chops the kebab and also the Biryani the chicken is a bit chewy for my preference but what I'm really looking forward to savoring is some of that plump Kaa it breaks off rather easily you're tasting the meat which is quite coarse and its grind but then you're also tasting a bit of the flar that comes from the gram FL I think this can certainly benefit from a bit more of the saru you can also see a bit of the gram flour that's held on to that mutton Min and like it has held on to that mutton that fless of that GLE hitu is also holding on to your pette not too much but a little the saru is quite tasty I want to get some more of the sambar onto that Kaa un that idly is a great accompaniment to all the dishes that I've tasted thus [Music] far that saru is fantastic along with that B I want to tast some of that mutton Curry so this I suspect will be mutton that will be a tad chewy because he said they typically look for an older Animal when it comes to the curry when it comes to the sambar whereas for the Biryani they want an animal that is Young so they want it to be [Music] when it comes to places like these they want that mutton to have a bit of a bite when that mutton has a bit of a bite you tend to chew on it and when you chew on it you're rewarded with the flavor of that Masala but having said that there are certain pieces that are quite soft raita and the mutton Biryani thank you thank thank you very much well this is I'm told the most popular dish here at namal man in addition to that B that steaming plate of mutton Biryani as a mark of respect to the Biryani I've got a fresh plate with the B there's plenty of meat here at least about four or five pieces of meat that I see in this biryani not large pieces small pieces but I think enough that conveys to you the flavor of the meat I love the aroma that's rising up from that Rice so this is a combination of the bullet rice and another local variety that they use I can smell the aroma of the coriander some of the mint that's rising up along with the steam from that Biryani to meet my [Music] nose the Biryani rice is rather fullsome in its flavors if the rice to me conveys a sort of feeling to my palette that it's complete in its flavors well then that Biryani has done its job I can taste a bit of the freshness that comes from the greens from the coriander from the mint there's a bit of the heat that I taste from the green chili so there's no green chili in the other dishes but I think out here is definitely the green chili that you can taste and then also some of the aromat I think there's probably also some fennel that goes into this and the aroma of it I can toally taste detect on my [Music] palette perfect let's go for a bit of the meat [Music] now flavor I love the biryani I met a couple of people as soon as I entered and they say you have to try the Biryani and I having tasted this biryani I know why so Biryani top seller mimu good very good thank you m I'm enjoying the flavor of that rice all in itself the meat in my opinion is not the softest and that's a character of the kind of flavors the kind of textures that they look for in the food here youly need to chew on it a bit but the flavor is all in the rice here some of the meat with the [Music] rice I'm a little distracted because suddenly the place is very crowded and and there's a host of people wondering what I'm doing I think you can also hear the inquisitive conversations around me I think I want to taste some of that mutton curry with that Biryani rice so when you come here let's say if they finished the meat in the Biryani I don't think you want to miss out much ask them for the Biryani rice the kushka and perhaps one of the gravies like this mutton Curry there's also a bit of the charby a bit of the fat and people love the fat around here s b m s b m saru thank you I was inquiring with um as to why some of the pieces are hard some of the pieces are soft he said well we get the whole animal and uh different parts of it go into every preparation and so that's why you'll probably taste some tough pieces some pieces that are tender so the preparations here are the sort that are quite rustic in keeping with the atmosphere of the place so this is sort of place where you just come in have your UT rather quickly and move on but having said that the Biryani the rice especially is a salort that will compel you to linger over it a bit I taste a little more of that [Music] P with a bit of that saru buy bsy saru I love the flavor the texture of the meat in that but I just wish that grham flour was a little understated in the manner in which it registers on the pallette he said you have to finish with the Anna white rice and some Rasam busy busy Rasam to digest everything flavor of the garlic The Tamarind in that Rasam and I think that Rasam will also benefit from being in the company of that remaining dag of the Kaa so all in all Nim man here in bayura makes for a tasty Highway stop my recommendation like in any place that's very popular get here early so that you don't have to jostle with the crowd and of all the dishes that I tasted well my top piics are certainly that mutton Biryani especially that Biryani rice that b goou to was something that I will order the next time around and also that mutton saru the chicken preparations well they are the sort that lend wholesome company to that chicken only Diner when he or she finds themselves at namah har man but otherwise it's the mutton dishes that are supremely popular here I think I'm going to get a little more of that sambar and some of that mutton as I wrap up my mealia the mutton CES also I found very rounded in their flavors and I guess that's why the character of the meat with the fat comes in there's a fair bit of the fat the charby too that floats around in all these gravies the chicken preparations I thought we a bit harsh when it came to the edge of the spice mix especially the coriander and the cumin so that's it from namah man here in bayura until the next time take care stay safe stay strong and happy [Music] eating well all that we tasted good enough I think to feed four people at least rounds up to 1290 rupees okay sir thank you if you'd like to

mutton Biryani yes sir oh chicken biryani I love the aroma of that Biryani is jostling with the Smoky atmosphere of the [Music] [Music] place oh Chicken [Music] Chops PE High Bean fantastic and I'm told the combination here is the idly that idly is soft with some of that b also get some of that m well we are on the Bangalore Mangalore highway it's about 1:00 in the afternoon and we've stopped for lunch bangaluru is 200 km behind me cesur is roughly about 25 km so it's that time of the afternoon when I was feeling a little hungry and i' had heard of this place called namama harim man here in bayura in Hassen District so that's where we've arrived for lunch I don't know what the food here is all about but I've received requests from the establishments and also a few recommendations over a period of time so I think lunch here should certainly be interesting hello how is the food very good yeah what are you having mutton Biryani mutton Biryani Namaste sir namas new Mr yes sir fan of you thank you very much nice to meet you thank you sir thank you owning chicken birani fish fry chicken m yeah very soft [Music] idly bit of a smoky atmosphere here but that's always nice because they do the cooking over a wood fired store mutton Biryani yes buet rice rice I love the aroma of that Biryani is jostling with the Smokey atmosphere of the place oh chicken [Music] birani yes sir CH yeah yeah CH powder powder definitely smell the coriander in that M Masala Mt [Music] m [Music] oh Chicken Chops mil [Music] only so basically what he says is that the younger the animal is better for a Biryani because you want that meat to really dissolve and if the animal is older then that does well in the sambar yeah I like that bright vious red color of the basically it's a peeled Bean fantastic [Music] so muton Chicken on the dish Chicken Chops chicken biryani cab and [Music] open well this is one of those places that's fairly modest in fact if I didn't put GPS on I would have quite easily overshot this particular location thank God for Google Maps but I think it's the food in this place that rules because although I've received requests from omes GAA on Instagram earlier I've received many recommendations thereafter and also many of the customers that I met here are people whove been here before so they've tried the Biryani they've tried the kebab and that's why they've return to taste what cooks for them thank you you well they also have mud here so in case you want to eat your mud with the saru you can also do that but I saw those soft Mal ID steaming away in that casserole and I think that's what I'm going to have with the [Music] saru thank youo B goo yeah chicken kebab baju chicken kebab and some soft idly [Music] yeah so out here I think uh um GAA insists on you eating in a manner that he would like you to eat muton Kaa mut M [Music] mut Chicken Chops one by one the dishes are coming our table is full so I've got the Chicken Chops here there's a chicken kebab here those are the only two chicken dishes that we have there's also a Biryani that they do this of course is the B gojou and this is the bti that is made with the a b that is the Heen Bean this is a dish that I really had my eyes on the moment you opened the lid and I saw these Plum juicy kaima there's also a bit of charby that you see here a bit of fat right on top this is the mutton Curry and then we have a soft malig idly with some saru and some bti I want to taste that bti first just by itself some Curry [Music] Leaf I think the curries here are certainly the s that grip hold of your throat with a spicy furor there's certain thickness to that b gojou and I'm told the combination here is the idly that idly is soft with some of that b also get some of that a b m told me so before you try anything else please try the B it's a very popular dish and having tasted only a few morels of it I completely believe him the B is soft clean rather well as well and just has a lightest of bites this time it's some of that sambar this is a curry I think there's also a bit of meat in that [Music] the preparations here are the Sal that grip fold of your [Music] throat so even when I saw it in the kitchen most of the dishes out here are the s that are prepared with the red chilies so thises a combination of the byi for the color the G and manatu which is a local Nati chili which has a lot of heat and that's really what you're tasting on the throat M that idly is nice and [Music] soft for those of you like your ragim mud you also have the option of that but it's been a while since I've had a good idly mutton saru so I thought this was the combination to try and with the [Music] B let's try some of that chicken kebab there's a bit of green Chutney that they serve the Kebab with so I'm told he doesn't use any color in his kebab and that seems to be the case because it's not a kebab that's bright crimson red in its color it's a kebab that crunches well has a bit of a juiciness to it as well but not so impactful on the pette as that boty and that mutton saru when we walked in here there was nobody but right now every table is taken every chair taken and there are people waiting for a seat at the table that's how popular is I think next for some of that Chicken Chops get some of the saru there that thick gravy I can definitely taste the flavor of the Masala in that a bit of the coriander a bit of the cumin that's what I'm tasting in that saru is a bit rough around the edges not as smooth as that mutton saru chicken do is a bit tough they only do a couple of chicken dishes and I suspect it's the mutton dishes that find most favor with the customers here the chicken is for the occasional perhaps visitor for those who don't eat mutton and they happen to be stuck with a group of uh mutton lovers well then they have the Chicken Chops the kebab and also the Biryani the chicken is a bit chewy for my preference but what I'm really looking forward to savoring is some of that plump Kaa it breaks off rather easily you're tasting the meat which is quite coarse and its grind but then you're also tasting a bit of the flar that comes from the gram FL I think this can certainly benefit from a bit more of the saru you can also see a bit of the gram flour that's held on to that mutton Min and like it has held on to that mutton that fless of that GLE hitu is also holding on to your pette not too much but a little the saru is quite tasty I want to get some more of the sambar onto that Kaa un that idly is a great accompaniment to all the dishes that I've tasted thus [Music] far that saru is fantastic along with that B I want to tast some of that mutton Curry so this I suspect will be mutton that will be a tad chewy because he said they typically look for an older Animal when it comes to the curry when it comes to the sambar whereas for the Biryani they want an animal that is Young so they want it to be [Music] when it comes to places like these they want that mutton to have a bit of a bite when that mutton has a bit of a bite you tend to chew on it and when you chew on it you're rewarded with the flavor of that Masala but having said that there are certain pieces that are quite soft raita and the mutton Biryani thank you thank thank you very much well this is I'm told the most popular dish here at namal man in addition to that B that steaming plate of mutton Biryani as a mark of respect to the Biryani I've got a fresh plate with the B there's plenty of meat here at least about four or five pieces of meat that I see in this biryani not large pieces small pieces but I think enough that conveys to you the flavor of the meat I love the aroma that's rising up from that Rice so this is a combination of the bullet rice and another local variety that they use I can smell the aroma of the coriander some of the mint that's rising up along with the steam from that Biryani to meet my [Music] nose the Biryani rice is rather fullsome in its flavors if the rice to me conveys a sort of feeling to my palette that it's complete in its flavors well then that Biryani has done its job I can taste a bit of the freshness that comes from the greens from the coriander from the mint there's a bit of the heat that I taste from the green chili so there's no green chili in the other dishes but I think out here is definitely the green chili that you can taste and then also some of the aromat I think there's probably also some fennel that goes into this and the aroma of it I can toally taste detect on my [Music] palette perfect let's go for a bit of the meat [Music] now flavor I love the biryani I met a couple of people as soon as I entered and they say you have to try the Biryani and I having tasted this biryani I know why so Biryani top seller mimu good very good thank you m I'm enjoying the flavor of that rice all in itself the meat in my opinion is not the softest and that's a character of the kind of flavors the kind of textures that they look for in the food here youly need to chew on it a bit but the flavor is all in the rice here some of the meat with the [Music] rice I'm a little distracted because suddenly the place is very crowded and and there's a host of people wondering what I'm doing I think you can also hear the inquisitive conversations around me I think I want to taste some of that mutton curry with that Biryani rice so when you come here let's say if they finished the meat in the Biryani I don't think you want to miss out much ask them for the Biryani rice the kushka and perhaps one of the gravies like this mutton Curry there's also a bit of the charby a bit of the fat and people love the fat around here s b m s b m saru thank you I was inquiring with um as to why some of the pieces are hard some of the pieces are soft he said well we get the whole animal and uh different parts of it go into every preparation and so that's why you'll probably taste some tough pieces some pieces that are tender so the preparations here are the sort that are quite rustic in keeping with the atmosphere of the place so this is sort of place where you just come in have your UT rather quickly and move on but having said that the Biryani the rice especially is a salort that will compel you to linger over it a bit I taste a little more of that [Music] P with a bit of that saru buy bsy saru I love the flavor the texture of the meat in that but I just wish that grham flour was a little understated in the manner in which it registers on the pallette he said you have to finish with the Anna white rice and some Rasam busy busy Rasam to digest everything flavor of the garlic The Tamarind in that Rasam and I think that Rasam will also benefit from being in the company of that remaining dag of the Kaa so all in all Nim man here in bayura makes for a tasty Highway stop my recommendation like in any place that's very popular get here early so that you don't have to jostle with the crowd and of all the dishes that I tasted well my top piics are certainly that mutton Biryani especially that Biryani rice that b goou to was something that I will order the next time around and also that mutton saru the chicken preparations well they are the sort that lend wholesome company to that chicken only Diner when he or she finds themselves at namah har man but otherwise it's the mutton dishes that are supremely popular here I think I'm going to get a little more of that sambar and some of that mutton as I wrap up my mealia the mutton CES also I found very rounded in their flavors and I guess that's why the character of the meat with the fat comes in there's a fair bit of the fat the charby too that floats around in all these gravies the chicken preparations I thought we a bit harsh when it came to the edge of the spice mix especially the coriander and the cumin so that's it from namah man here in bayura until the next time take care stay safe stay strong and happy [Music] eating well all that we tasted good enough I think to feed four people at least rounds up to 1290 rupees okay sir thank you if you'd like to support the work that we do at Food Lovers TV do consider joining our

A highlight of Brahmin's Soda Factory is its use of a soda-making machine specially sourced from England, adding a touch of history and authenticity to the experience. \"}]\n",
