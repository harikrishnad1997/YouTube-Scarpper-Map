      " so the third Biryani that we about to taste is a Biryani called The Don Biryani which is very local very typical to Bengaluru to kataa I'm just going to tell you straight up a bani forklift is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my life this is one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to I'm going to Nestle some of this out of the Don into the plate Don baniani [Music] so Mark out here to celebrate a Biryani tradition that goes back decades and this is called the shadik Biryani oh right out of the pot kpal kpal eat me yes where's your friend Mark where's your friend Mark it's talking to [Music] us m so mark this is our second Biryani stop here yes and for this biryani we've come to Taj Hotel out here they celebrate a Biryani tradition called the Shiki Biryani this is usually a Biryani that is cooked over a Woodfire during wedding special occasions okay and what's interesting is that this restaurant which is about 90 years old also Cooks it over a wood fire wow so that's what we're going to explore we're going to catch a bit of its making and most importantly it's tasting definitely welome thank you very much s pleasure to I want to introduce you to a very special friend hi very nice to meet you what a pleasure thank you thank you and sad represents the third generation of the family that's been tending to this very special Biryani tradition officially for about 89 years yes but I think unofficially perhaps nearly 100 years all the pots are [Music] burning chicken so they're doing both the chicken and the mutton Biryani so the mutton Biryani is usually done in a copper muton [Music] M the lamb that's going in [Music] so there's some combination of coriander mint salt and is that Ginger goes in that Ginger p man what a combination what is this now there's some yogurt going in C is going in chopped tomatoes chopped tomatoes go in some of the W from the C just the water so the wood that's used here is the casurina the primary character of this wood is that it allows for them to build the dump so it gives them the charcoal it doesn't break down into Ash okay yeah completely it burns long it burns and high heat that's right casarina or the Indian Beach wood that we saw there or The Tamarind yeah these are the woods that are typically used when they make a Biryani on wood fire okay [Music] so cooking the meat is a two-step process first is searing it in the Masala yes and when it has seared enough that's when the water goes in and now the meat will boil in that Masala [Music] yes you know one of the most challenging tasks of a Woodfire is regulating the temperature that's what he's doing now he's trying to reduce the heat so he wants the meat to simmer not to boil too much in that stock and that's the reason why he's removing the wood so he will take it then he'll bring it back and that's the way they regulate the heat when they make that [Music] Biryani so when it comes to biryanis in India there are two types one is a Kachi akne and a paky akne a paky akne is this where you prepare the akne with the meat and the meat cooks and then you add the rice okay then there are some biryanis where you prepare K where the meat is not cooked yet it's only marinated and that's when the rice goes on top and then the whole thing is steamed okay together so that's a hyderabadi style oh okay okay this is a jira sambar rice Mark and this rice comes from a place called bwan in West Bengal spice is everything that is [Music] not so he's portioning the rice between the chicken and the mutton okay the rice that comes out towards the end is the one that's cooked the most okay and therefore that's the one that stays on top and doesn't need to cook as much the rice that came out first is at the bottom so it will cook so you will see that now he'll introduce heat once again to the Biryani hes all right that is skills that's 200 kilos mark That's 200 kilos that you just rolled away just like that wow and it's hot so this is the saffron milk oh saffron with milk yeah saffron so the saffron has dissolved into the milk [Music] okay so when you open the pot you will see all three colors yeah so he's making sure not to fully stir it right just that top of the rice he's just stiring mixing in that saffron a little bit so you have kind of that color swirl yes so now the dumb style where it's going to be sealed think a cloth goes around the outside they almost swaddling that Biryani to [Music] sleep and now he's scooping in those coals actually putting it on the sides of the pot as well scooping it around Distributing it around the pot Can You Feel the temperature building I can I can indeed there's only the burning ambers that tells you the heat that's contained in them it's not the flame but it's the heat that's trapped in that so the interesting thing about this biryani mark is that as it now comes to Dum they also add heat once again at the bottom okay you know in some of the other biryanis they take the heat away yeah but they add more heat now they add more heat now so every place will have a different approach to doing the thumb but the concept is the same you seal it in and it Cooks in that steam okay the word for that steam is Bop oh okay Bop that Steam from the Biryani yeah a whole bowl of ghee is going to go in yes but you can see that Rice look at how fluffy it is you remember he's put it to sleep yes now he's slowly jostling it away wake up waking it up que wants to eat you there you go the splash of the geek oh wow [Music] so Mark for me one of the things that I always look forward to is to taste the Biryani as soon as it comes off that thing okay okay just a bite right out of the pot just a bite right out of the pot oh there's the meat revealing itself yes it's making its first appearance [Music] oh right out of the pot this is as fresh as it gets yes oh oh the spices the cardamom the cinnamon in there and that grein is just perfect I love that swirl of ghee and saffron yes this is a Biryani that calls your name even if you place it an arms length away it's as alluring is that Mark kol kol eat me yes where's your friend Mark where's your friend Mark it's talking to us let's dive into this yes we can't resist that call okay first [Music] bite oh wow M that melt in your mouth oh it has this incredible cardamom like richness to it you got the lushness of the ghee yes and then somewh that sweet gentle saress of the Tomato to cuts that right away and maybe the curd as well m a very simple Biryani in the manner that it comes together simple yet luxurious that's right it has a luxurious feel some of the meat this time Mark bone tender Ah that's hard look at that look at that that's what we're after that meat pure meaty deliciousness it really tastes pure that's right yeah really clean tasting very clean tasting very deep tasting the spices are not overpowering to cover it up not at all it's just clean pure fresh tender oo I think this is is a Biryani yeah that we'll have a lot of fun with on the table I I believe so you want to spend some time with it like in India we say meaning at leisure you want to get to know it a little better you want to take your time let the entire experience just marinate in your mouth absolutely and just baby it into your stomach oh let's move to the table let's move to the table [Music] so this is basically the part of gold here but what's equally interesting are the adornments on the side so this is a kadu dalcha which is a very traditional accompaniment you don't find this very often but you find the Bata and then of course there's also the really chunky onions cucumbers that's right so what these CES do is they help you cleanse your palette in between tasting the biryani that one will have a sar acidic sort of a flavor note this one will be a little more gentler a little more creamier with the lentils in [Music] it huge pieces of mutton tender falling apart mutton the tomatoes and onions in there oh thank you very much [Music] [Music] m m oh oh wow the flavors have started to mingle together now the flavors the length of the flavor has certainly deepened yes the spices that are subtle yet not overpowering also if you note the manner in which that rice is burdened with the weight of that akne you can certainly feel weight in every grain of the rice yes so it's not relying too much on the garam masala but it's relying on that liquid on that broth to seep into every grain of rice yes and flavor it inside out yes through and through it's just flavor the metin but the pureness the cleanness moving into the meat it's falling off the bone still hot and tender [Music] that lamb it's so good and so tender and so fresh you know what's interesting about tasting the meat in this biryani is that you can taste the true essence of the flavor of the Lamb there is no garam masala in this biryani yeah it's not strong on the spices that's right there's a Biryani that allows you to appreciate the character of the the animal yes in terms of its flavor you fully appreciate the flavor of the the lamb the texture it's like if you close your eyes you can feel the texture of the rice every grain in your mouth okay I'm going to move into that eggplant and mix in a little bit so the eggplant and just that gravy can kind of work it in massage it in scoot that into your rice m not only plant with tomatoes in there that's right can you also taste a bit of the coriander oh yeah the coriander seeds some of that spicing that comes throughness of it the hardness of it oh and it has a bit of a chili chck to it as well that's right I mean it just gives a totally different dimension to the Biryani so typically you know when you look at biryanis the way they constructed there are some biryanis which have a lot of spice mix in the Biryani itself and some that will call for accompaniment should you want to spice things up this is an example of the latter yeah so of example when you taste that Bon Ka Kata you can taste somewhere the layering now of a bit of the spice mix perhaps beginning with the coriander powder you know Mark another interesting character of this biryani I'm sure you would have tasted it already now is when you taste the rice just by itself there's a certain salty tone to it you know which is the character which comes from the fat yes I can taste that it's phenomenal oh and that eggplant Curry is just blowing my taste buds now that added tartness [Music] okay so next up we'll try the ash [Music] Gord this is called the dalcha mark dalcha oh so there's D melted into it [Music] lentil much more gentler mhm creamier oh a little richness the starchiness of the doll in there oh man the gent also there's a bit of garlic that goes into this typically when they make this dala at home there's also some mutton Bones the stock that goes into to flavor this dal okay so out here in the restaurant because the vegetarian dala they don't keep the bones in it it's not lacking in flavor absolutely is absolutely flavor packed again like a gravy that just caresses your your bani oh man another absolutely phenomenal bani but completely different what we hard in the morning right you know that's the thing with Biryani and India every 100 km sometimes 50 km that you travel you'll find a different Biryani and in a place like bangaluru you only need to travel a few kilometers yes to taste a different Biryani oh I promise you a city like bangaluru has at least about 6 or eight different types of biryanis that are quite interesting this Shiki Biryani is certainly one of them yes yes and I think that's part of the reason why birani is one of the most celebrated dishes on Earth M there's nothing quite like it that comforts you from the outside in and the inside out like a plate of birani you can try such a huge diversity of different biris with such different flavor profiles even though they might use similar ingredients different methods techniques but it's that diversity of bani that just makes it such a powerful powerful dish that that's right that that commands respect and attention and the love of millions of people around the world and India is truly at the Forefront to us Biryani is not just meat and rice and spices to us Biryani is an emotion when you celebrate you have a Biryani when you need some comforting you have a Biryani when you fall in love you have a Biryani and then you miss someone you drown your sorrows in that Biryani that's what a Biryani to us the power of a Biryani is all about M and I'm so happy that we have the opportunity to share some fine specimens of the Biryani with you here in N Bengaluru thank you thank you this one is spectacular M I'm so happy that you love it [Music] wow so Mark we are here at the third Biryani place so the third Biryani that we about to taste is a Biryani called The Don Biryani which is very local very typical to Bengaluru to Karnataka especially this part of Karnataka all right and the place to have it when you want to have that Biryani is shivaji military Hotel excellent this is an E3 that goes back 90 years and is easily one of the most popular e trees for this biryani wow okay I've heard a lot about this place I'm excited to try it fantastic let's go and sa us some Don [Music] Biryani so this restaurant is housed in what we call a CH tree so CH Tre is typically where weddings happen so the atmosphere here is quite festive it almost seems like you're going to somebody's wedding but they're all going to taste the Don Biryani [Music] okay I think we have arrived oh hello hello namaskara namaskar there's a crowd of people just waiting outside of the door the delicious Aroma wafting through the air [Music] meet Mr Raji Mr Raji yeah very nice to meet you third generation behind shivaji military Hotel so there is a Don Biryani that is ready there and this one just beginning to get constructed tells you the volume of the Don biryanis that gets consumed here if you talk about bangaluru and Don Biryani it has to be shivaji military Hotel D does it mean Lea it's a vessel fashionate of dry plan and leaf so when they place the hot Biryani in that that Biryani reacts with that planton leaf and that indues its Aroma to that Biryani as well so that's why a Don [Music] Biryani so in addition to the Don Biryani it's also the other meaty dishes on the side that are very popular okay so whether it's the chicken pepper fry chicken fry chicken fry pieces mutton fry liver mutton K mutton liver so it's a meat lovers Paradise if you love your meat you have to be here this is the fourth generation very cool right here in the making so you know this is a business that's been around for 90 years he'll be around for another 90 years very cool that's the culture in the family he's preserving the tradition [Music] absolutely what is special about the Biryani here and what are some of the main key ingredients quality and tasty ingredients na style na style he says it's quality taste even when it comes to the ingredients they for regional local ingredients like for example Ginger comes from his farm coriander comes from his farm so he has his own Farm get it Tomatoes we'll get it and I think beyond all of that it is their personal involvement so there are two brothers location Rajiv loesh opened in the morning and he left just before we came here Rajiv must have come a few hours later and he will now close so it's the brothers who are constantly involved working all the dishes I think that's what makes a huge difference so out here the process is very different so they cook it on a gas and then the end is all done on charcoal there is a forklift here oh are we going on the forklift that's right yes now you know they're serious about the quantity of Biryani they do [Music] I'm just going to tell you straight up a bani forklift is one of the coolest things I've ever seen in my life I think there should be a standard s so if you want to flaunt your Biryani cred do you have a forklift if you don't well you don't qualify you're not shaji level you're not shivaji level if you're not using power tools you have not reached the the next level of [Music] bani they've been around for the last so many years so people know them yeah so when people come here it's like they're coming to their house so there's no place here they'll ask Rajiv okay wherever just give us one chair or you will stand you just give us aani we eat so therefore you'll see people musling their way it's like a home and the problem in a home there's always that much space but their friends their whole Community has grown to such an extent people don't mind waiting 30 minutes 45 minutes they don't mind standing there there will be a little chaos moment they Place their hand in that Don Biryani and they take it to their mouth that's it all those problems just [Music] disappear so well Mark how was the kitchen tour this is one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to you know I love Mark he's a guy who sees the good in everything this place is busy and busy is an understatement this has to be probably one of the busiest restaurants that you visited yes one of the most happening restaurants in that sense because there so much happening everywhere that you have very little control over so when you come here you basically sub yourself to a higher force and that force is the powers that be at shii military Hotel they will deem when you shall eat how you shall eat how long you will wait but eventually the reason why people wait and go through that experience is because of what you will find on the plate here the food overpowers it all the food overpowers it all and this is the experience we also have one of Mark's most arant fans here Dr Anan Shino and uh so he's going to be joining us on the shagi military Hotel lunch too UT Don birani excited doc absolutely absolutely it's a pleasure to meet two icons in the food industry thank you and Mark this is the experience here if there are two of you who come and you have a table of six well you will make new friends oh yeah and I think in a manner of speaking this table that we have here there also another gentleman who's right opposite us it represents the overall lunch experience at military hotel I think so so well the food's here and Rohit who's the nephew of Raji has brought the food to us he's been very instrumental in helping us get a table here thank you thank you Ro thank you and this mutton Biryani thank you very much birani Mt Kima the mutton Kima mutton Kima pepper chicken the pepper chicken that we saw frying in the kitchen that's right MPP [Music] it's a boat of birani I'm going to Nestle some of this out of the Don into the [Music] plate thank you Chicken Chops Chicken Chops nice Don baniani [Music] M again the flavor is starting to build the pepper the green chilies the aromatics so this is also a very complex spice blend and you can taste that at different levels so whether it's the prickly heat of the pepper somewhere a bit of the aromatic influence of perhaps the cloves the staran the ginger the ginger in there is just absolutely stand out too oh man see this is the reason why people wait your mark they go through all this but when they wait and they tuck into that Don Biryani that's what happens to them and they're like all this for given totally washed away M look at that mut in it it's finger tender [Music] oh wow oh it's absorbed all of that flavor all those spices are embedded in that meat all the way to the Bone if you notice in this the meat helps cut a bit of the spice that you will taste in the rice so every once in a while if the spice gets to you save a bit of the meat go for it and that meat with its fat will cut away some of that pepper [Music] heat and then something El see that almost everyone just immediately start to pour lather onto their Biryani is this sauce what is this sauce exactly so this is basically something called chera so it's a combination of various greens that go in there's some mint there's some coriander plenty of chili that goes in onions so it's basically a fortified sort of a gravy just in case you want to give your Biryani a little extra kick a little extra kick yes yes I [Music] do oh you just see it's melting onions in [Music] there oh wow if you thought your bani could not get more flavorful think again oh that sauce yeah the minty freshness with the caramelized onions that melt in your mouth the pepper the pepper just embedded through and through the spice starts building oh a bit of oiliness in that sauce also so that's the oil that goes into cooking the onions and all of that it also helps bring a little more moisture to that Biryani rice so if you want a little more of that gravy sort of a feeling oh man you got to be joking with the flavor but if you ask me honestly that Biryani rice by itself yeah has all the flavor that you need it's more than enough it's more than enough and especially Mark when you got all these meaty sides I think we got to slowly now begin to work towards them we do I maybe you should try the mutton [Music] fry just leaves the bone completely Barren and you've got just that again finger tender pieces of meat [Music] man can you feel that pepper hit that insane pepper hit the black pepper coarsely ground M so it just unleashes on your tongue also in this meat is cooked twice so it's first cooked in a gravy and then they dry it out and that's when they embellish it with more pepper and that's the Searing heat that you're tasting on your tongue Mark oh man oh you'll be licking every bone clean here yeah that pepper is absolutely [Music] Sensational oh that gelatinous yeah joint material I think next we should try the mutton Kima [Music] they call it the [Music] K it has a Nuttin to it that comes from the dried fenu Greek that goes into it can you also taste a bit of the stares in there some yes yes it's so the star yes that's what it hits you too yeah this licoricey burst yeah the minty freshness the tender silky texture you think the flavors could not get more complex and stronger and they do with every bite it just keeps building what's interesting in that is you are the star on E so therefore you also have a bit of sweetness along with that spice yeah no wow [Music] wow it's one of the most exciting meatballs I've ever had in my life it's a roller coaster in your mouth it's basically like a street Orchestra where every performer is trying his best to outdo the other that's what's happening on my tongue now yeah the flavors are competing against each other on your tongue that's right the club is fighting against the pepper the staran the the dried fenu Greek there's a lot that's happening there's a there's a little bit of a civil war happening in your mouth this is the black pepper [Music] chicken oh yes oh cascading down a waterfall of meat juice [Music] wow this one you're tasting more the flavor of the coriander yes you know the dry spice has this greenish this greenish Masala flavor to it but again the pepper is just standing out this is like this is a groundbreaking meal this is some of the greatest flavors like you'll ever have so what happens typically is also all these dishes everything is not available every time sometimes you make a mutton sometimes chicken sometimes a Kaa whatever else but whatever is presented before you is a sort that immediately creates that impact when you're a child you go home you have to sit wherever they ask you to sit you have to eat whatever is given to you if your mom is busy in the kitchen you have to wait if you want to throw a tantrum well throw a tantrum but at the end of the day when she feeds you that meal it is the Sal that will please your heart and touch your Soul yes that's why people return to shii military Hotel time and time again yes if you go to Google you will see a lot of people complaining about the chaos Etc but yet they will return yes [Music] true without a doubt this is one of the greatest meals I've ever had in my life despite all the chaos and everything else the wait that adds to the to the experience that that's an extra bonus that's an extra points that's what brings people here right yes this food packaged in that experience yeah that's what shagi military hotel is all about again it's like it's like the meal is it's a victory you know once you've waited it out once you've found a table once you've elbowed your way in a little bit that Victory and then your taste buds just are rejoicing I need a few days just to process all of the flavors fantastic and we hope you enjoyed this

       "'The video explores three different biryani restaurants in Bangalore, India. The second stop is Taj Hotel, home to the traditional Shiki Biryani. This biryani is unique because it is cooked over a wood fire, a tradition the 90-year-old restaurant has maintained for almost a century. The hosts guide viewers through the preparation, highlighting the use of specific wood types (like Casuarina and Tamarind) for their slow burn and high heat. They detail the two-step meat cooking process and the layered rice assembly, emphasizing the importance of steaming and the \"dum\" technique for trapping flavor. The hosts savor the biryani, praising its fluffy texture, subtle spice blend, and the prominent cardamom, cinnamon, and ghee flavors. They also enjoy traditional accompaniments like brinjal curry and dalcha, appreciating how each element complements the biryani. \\n\\nHere are three follow-up questions related to the video:\\n\\n1. **The video mentions two types of biryani preparation: \"Kacchi\" and \"Pakki.\"  Could you elaborate on the differences between these styles, beyond what\\'s described in the video?**\\n2. **The hosts rave about the Shiki Biryani\\'s subtle spices, allowing the lamb flavor to shine. Are there other regional biryani styles known for their minimalist spice blends, and what makes them unique?**\\n3. **Beyond the accompaniments shown, what other dishes or drinks would traditionally be served alongside a Shiki Biryani at a celebratory meal in Bangalore?** \\n'"
